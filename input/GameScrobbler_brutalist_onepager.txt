Digital Sovereignty for the Gaming Generation
1. The Core Problem
Gaming is where today’s youth live, connect, and learn — but it runs on a feudal model where
platforms own everything: identity, achievements, memories, reputation, and behavioral data.
Players build value they cannot own or move. This contradicts Europe’s vision for Digital
Sovereignty, where individuals have transparency, fairness, and ownership of their digital
selves.
2. Who’s Hurt (The Human Cost)
This affects real people — not statistics.
- Invisible Talent: Youth in emerging markets & diaspora communities develop strategic,
cognitive, and teamwork skills, but none of it is visible to education or employment pathways.
- Disenfranchised Creatives: Indie developers across the EU are locked out by closed APIs
and data monopolies.
- The Player: Loss of agency, identity fragmentation, and exposure to toxicity without the tools
to manage digital well-being.
Gaming is the largest cultural space in the world — yet the least equitable.
3. Our Intervention: PlayGraph
PlayGraph is the user-owned, interoperable infrastructure layer for gaming. A protocol
designed for data portability, transparency, and ownership. Think of it as a digital health
record for gameplay — but for skill, reputation, and identity.
- The Tech: Fully aligned with GDPR (portability), DMA (anti-gatekeeping), and DSA (platform
transparency).
- The Shift: Your progress becomes portable. Your skills become verifiable. Your data usage
becomes transparent.
4. Social Impact

We shift the paradigm from extraction to empowerment.
Economic Mobility: We translate gameplay behavior into soft-skill indicators and competency
signals — opening employment and education pathways for underrepresented youth.
Digital Dignity: Players gain meaningful control over their identity and how AI systems train on
their behavior.
Open Innovation: We democratize ethical data access, enabling European studios and
startups to compete with global giants.
5. Why Now & Why WAC
Regulatory Momentum: The Data Act, DMA, DSA, and the AI Act all push toward
interoperability, transparency, and user-controlled data — exactly what PlayGraph
operationalizes.
Cultural Timing: Gaming has overtaken social networks as the primary identity space for
youth.
Why WAC: WAC champions digital rights, youth empowerment, and inclusion.
GameScrobbler is the infrastructure that brings those values to life.
Together, we can make gaming the first global ecosystem where users truly own who they
are.
