Purpose
We agree to work together for three (3) months to build and validate a specific venture, with the goal of gaining
clarity quickly on whether it is worth continuing. The phase is focused on execution and learning, while aiming to
reach a working MVP and a decision-ready point.

•
Leads execution end-to-end with speed and ownership
•
Designs, builds, and iterates the operational engine and MVP
•
Keeps progress moving through practical tests and learning
•
Delivers a handover-ready setup by the end of the phase
Roles — Co-Founder B (Partner)
•
Contributes ideas, intuition, network, and experience
•
May be involved as much or as little as desired
•
Provides direction and feedback as needed (not required day-to-day)
How Decisions Are Made
•
Ideas may originate from either co-founder
•
Design and day-to-day execution sit with Co-Founder A
•
Direction and interpretation are discussed jointly
•
Evidence and learnings outweigh opinions
Start Date, Duration & Continuity
This collaboration starts on January 1 and runs for three (3) months.
If the parties mutually agree to continue, the collaboration will move forward based on what has been built and
learned, under terms to be agreed at that time.
Compensation
•
$3,000 per month paid to Co-Founder A
•
Pre-approved expenses reimbursed as agreed
•
Paid monthly
Intellectual Property
All venture-specific assets, implementations, materials, and industry-related intellectual property (including but not
limited to birth tourism, citizenship, residency, immigration, and related agency models) remain the property of the
venture. Co-Founder A retains the unrestricted right to reuse general professional know-how, methods,
frameworks, systems, and experience, provided they are not used to directly replicate or compete with the venture.
Shared Understanding
This phase is about buying clarity fast and maintaining momentum. If it works well, next steps can be discussed;
otherwise, both parties part cleanly and with respect.
