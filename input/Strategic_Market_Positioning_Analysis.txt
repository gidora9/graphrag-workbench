Analysis Goal:Evaluate all three against market trends, competitive saturation, and defensible positioning.
010203
Deep Spain Focus
Go deep in Spain with
comprehensive relocation
services on top of immigration
(visa).
Global DNV Focus
Focus on Digital Nomad Visas
globally wherever available (64
countries).
Citizenship Pathway
Target personas seeking second
nationality and long-term
residency.

SPAIN'S COMPETITIVE EDGE
■
Startup Law (2022):20% local income allowance
■
Beckham Law:24% flat tax rate for 6 years
■
Citizenship Pathway:2 years for Latin Americans
■
Infrastructure:World-class digital connectivity
CRITICAL INSIGHT: Spain is an engineered
ecosystem designed to convert nomads into long-
term EU residents.

COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE
The Four Quadrants: Identifying the Mid-Market Gap
Q1: Full-Service Guardians
High-touch, enterprise-focused, opaque pricing. Too expensive
for mid-market.
Q2: Integrated Hybrids (Target)
Fixed-fee, tech-enabled, compliance-first. Serves the
underserved mid-market (€8K-€12K).
Q3: Global Digital Processors
Pure tech, high volume. Lacks deep local expertise.
Q4: Local Niche Specialists
Single-service, budget-conscious. Limited scale.

STRATEGIC TAKEAWAY
The mid-market segment is underserved. It demands the
predictability of Q3 with the expertise of Q1—precisely what Q2
offers.

APPROACH 1: DEEP SPAIN FOCUS
RECOMMENDED STRATEGY
MARKET OPPORTUNITY
■
Spain is the #1 ranked destination with
strongest regulatory framework.
■
Mid-market enterprise segment is
underserved (gap between RMCs and tech
platforms).
■
Target pricing: €8k-€12k per relocation.
REVENUE MODEL (5-YEAR)
Initial DNV + Beckham:€8k-€12k
Annual Compliance:€3k-€5k/yr
Relocation Services:€5k-€8k
LTV: €30,000 - €50,000
COMPETITIVE
ADVANTAGES
■
Defensible
Positioning:
Deep local expertise is hard
to replicate.
■
High-Value
Bundle:
DNV + Beckham Law + PE
Risk Audit.
■
Long-Term
Revenue:
Clients stay 2-10 years for
citizenship.
■
Geographic
Expansion:
Leverage success to
Portugal/Italy.
■
B2B
Partnerships:
Local partner for global
platforms.
STRATEGIC FIT
■
Aligns with market trends showing Spain as
the premier hub.
■
Positions Benidos/IIM/GMI in the high-value
Quadrant 2 (Tech/Compliance Hybrid).
Risk Mitigation:
Fixed-fee pricing addresses budget
predictability. Tech-enabled delivery counters
inefficiency.

APPROACH 2: GLOBAL DNV FOCUS
Not Recommended: High Barrier, Low Differentiation
MARKET REALITY
While 64 countries offer DNVs, the market is dominated by well-funded tech
giants like Deel (35k+ clients) and Jobbatical (99.9% success rate). These
incumbents possess massive scale, capital, and technology advantages that
are difficult to replicate.
CRITICAL CHALLENGES
✕Platform Saturation:Competing against $20B+ market incumbents.
✕Lack of Differentiation:Cannot match global scale or tech investment.
✕Commoditization:Visa processing becomes a low-margin volume game.
✕No Switching Costs:Clients easily move to cheaper alternatives.
✕Regulatory
Complexity:
Managing 64 frameworks is operationally
expensive.
ALTERNATIVE MODEL
Instead of competing directly, act as a B2B
local service partner for global platforms.
Leverage their channels while providing the
deep Iberian expertise they lack.
STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT
Going global means competing where
you're weakest (scale, capital) against
entrenched players. The smarter play is
partnering with them, not competing.

APPROACH 3: CITIZENSHIP PATHWAY FOCUS
Recommended as Integrated Component, Not Standalone Strategy
MARKET OPPORTUNITYSERVICE COMPLEXITY & VALUE
Why This Should Be Integrated, Not Standalone
✓Natural upsell: Start with DNV, convert to citizenship✓Higher ARPA: €30k-50k over 5-10 years
✓Defensible expertise: Complexity creates switching costs✓Geographic advantage: Spain's 2-year pathway is unique
Only 3 countries (Spain, Greece, Czechia) offer direct DNV-
to-citizenship pathways.
•
Targeting Passport Seekers: HNWIs with high willingness to
pay.
•
Long-term engagement (2-10 years) creates stable recurring
revenue streams.
•
Requires sophisticated legal/tax advisory (Beckham Law).
•
Permanent Establishment (PE) risk mitigation for employers.
•
Complex family reunification and asset structuring needs.
•
STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATION
Combine Approach 1 (Deep Spain) + Approach 3 (Citizenship Pathways)
Position as "Spain Citizenship Specialists" targeting both volume (DN Seekers) and value (Passport Seekers).
Risk: Standalone focus limits volume.
