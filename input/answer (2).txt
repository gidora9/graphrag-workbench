Turning Play into Trust
How gaming data becomes identity
15 Oct 2025

Gaming Identity Without Memory
•
Millions of hours of play are siloed across separate platforms
•
Multiple launchers create walled gardens and chaos
•
Players lose their story when they switch games or devices
•
Organizers can’t see who’s real across titles
Platform 
A
Platform 
B
Platform C
[1][4]

Consequences of Fragmentation
Players
• No persistent persona
• Smurfs & toxicity
• Reputation resets
Organizers
• Manual vetting
• Smurf fraud
• Time-consuming operations
Platforms
• Duplicate sign ups‑
• Isolated metrics
• Missed synergy
[2][3][1][4]

Core Need: A Translation Layer
Data in Silos
Locked, fragmented histories
Identity & Trust
Portable meaning & authenticity
To fix fragmentation, we need a layer that translates raw play into personhood: interpret behaviours, verify authenticity 
and make identity portable.
[4][3]

Mechanism of Proof
Gameplay Data
Numbers & Stats
• Totals, wins, hours
• Leaderboards & rankings
• Recaps like Wrapped
Narrative & Insight
• How you play, not just what
• Personality traits & patterns
• AI-generated profiles
Our minimal test: can behaviour data describe a person in a way that feels real?

Outcome & Hypothesis
To be credible, our experiment must be falsifiable.
We pre define thresholds: if real results don’t exceed them, the ‑
hypothesis is rejected and we pivot.

If Proven: Path Forward
Recognition
The system sees you – emotional 
resonance and personal insight.
Verification
It proves you – your history becomes 
trust for communities.
Portability
It travels with you – portable identity 
across titles and platforms.
A successful experiment opens the door to a trusted, portable gaming identity layer.
[1][2][3][4]

If Disproven: Pivot & Focus
Recognition
Verification
Data Infrastructure
If the AI roast doesn’t resonate, we shift focus to unifying data.
• Build a unified, cross platform data pipeline for developers‑
• Provide analytics and portability via APIs
• Revisit identity once ecosystems are unified
[4][3][2]

Conclusion & Next Steps
We believe play can describe who you are.
Our first experiment is a leap of faith: let AI analyse your patterns and tell your story. If it works, we unlock trust and portability 
across gaming. If not, we still build the infrastructure the industry needs.
