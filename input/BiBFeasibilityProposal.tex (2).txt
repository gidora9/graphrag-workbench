Feasibility Plan – Executive One-Pager
Executive Summary
Born in Brazil is a milestone-based feasibility initiative designed to validate a premium immi-
gration pathway before forming a company or assigning equity. The objective is to de-risk the
concept through real execution, generate a repeatable playbook, and enable a clear go/no-go
decision based on evidence.
Core Parameters
•Monthly Stipend:3,000
•Duration:Up to 36 months, strictly milestone-based.
•Milestones:(1) Baby citizenship secured; (2) Parents’ residency/naturalization path se-
cured.
•Exit Protection:Stipend stops immediately; full handover of materials; no further claims.
Funding Rule (Locked):Feasibility follows a strict binary rule.
Either (A)Fully SponsoredOR (B)Co-Founding from Day One(50/50 split). Mixed
models are excluded.

Appendix: Supporting Data & Market Intelligence
A. One-Time Project Cost Estimates
Costs are milestone-triggered and project-specific (not compensation).
• Legal & Immigration (Brazil): 5k – 12k
• Medical (Delivery & Care): 4k – 8k
• Certified Docs, Relocation, Advisory: 5k – 14k
•Total Indicative Range: 14k – 34k
B. Breakeven Logic (Conservative)
Breakeven is defined as the recovery of feasibility costs.
•Year-1 Exposure (Sponsored):36k (Stipend) + 24k (Costs) =60k Total.
•Recovery:With client fees at 30k–50k, breakeven occurs within1–2 cases.
C. Market Demand Drivers
• High-net-worth families seeking geopolitical risk hedging ("Plan B" passports).
• Brazil chosen forjus soli(unconditional birthright citizenship) and democratic passport strength.
• Absence of quota-based or investment-heavy constraints common in EU paths.
D. Supporting Documentation Generated
Internal playbooks, case files, private hospital pricing data, and legal compliance checklists.
E. Market Landscape & Trends
•Global Growth:The birth tourism market is valued at approx. $300M (2024) and projected
to reach over $600M by 2035 (CAGR∼6.8%).
•Shift to LATAM:Restrictive visa policies in North America are shifting demand toward South
America. Brazil is the fastest-growing hub due to accessiblejus soli(unconditional birthright
citizenship).
•Key Hubs:
– Florianópolis:Popular with families seeking safety and quality of life ("Baby Brazil"
hub).
– São Paulo / Rio:Centers for high-complexity medical infrastructure.
•Drivers:Geopolitical instability (specifically regarding Russia and the Middle East) and the
desire for visa-free EU access.

F. Competitive Landscape
The market is currently polarized between low-cost "fixers" and high-end generalist concierges,
with no dominant standardized player.
CompetitorEst. Pricing  Positioning & Model
BirthAway$2k – $3.5kBudget/Volume.Transactional model focusing on document pro-
cessing and basic logistics.
BabyInBrazil∼$8kMid-Tier Specialist.Regional focus (Florianópolis). Includes trans-
fers, translation, and comfort services.
Hale HealthCustomLuxury Medical.High-net-worth focus. Armored transport and cu-
rated medical teams.
Shadow Market$5k – $35kUnregulated.Informal operators charging predatory rates for "guar-
anteed" outcomes. High reputational risk.
G. Strategic Gaps & Opportunities
1.Legitimacy Deficit:The market is plagued by informal "fixers" and price gouging. High-
value clients are seeking legal certainty and corporate transparency, which the current
shadow market cannot provide.
2.Lack of Standardization:No current player offers a standardized, milestone-based "play-
book" that guarantees transparency across medical, legal, and logistic verticals.
3.The "Venture" Void:Existing competitors operate as lifestyle businesses or travel agen-
cies. There is a clear opportunity to build a scalable, defensible asset class (BiB) rather
than just a service agency.
