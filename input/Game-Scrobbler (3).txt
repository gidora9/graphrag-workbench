Game Scrobbler
Digital Sovereignty for the Gaming 
Generation

THE CORE PROBLEM
Gaming is where today's youth live, connect, and 
learn 4 but it runs on a feudal model where 
platforms own everything: identity, achievements, 
memories, reputation, and behavioral data.
Players build value they cannot own or move.This contradicts Europe's vision for Digital 
Sovereignty, where individuals have 
transparency, fairness, and ownership of their 
digital selves.

WHO'S HURT
The Human Cost
This affects real people 4 not statistics.
Invisible Talent
Youth in emerging markets & diaspora communities 
develop strategic, cognitive, and teamwork skills, but 
none of it is visible to education or employment 
pathways.
Disenfranchised Creatives
Indie developers across the EU are locked out by closed 
APIs and data monopolies.
The Player
Loss of agency, identity fragmentation, and exposure to 
toxicity without the tools to manage digital well-being.
Gaming is the largest cultural space in the world 4 
yet the least equitable.

OUR INTERVENTION
PlayGraph
PlayGraph is the user-owned, interoperable infrastructure layer for gaming.
A protocol designed for data portability, transparency, and ownership.
Think of it as a digital health record for gameplay 4 but for skill, reputation, and identity.
The Tech
Fully aligned with GDPR (portability), DMA (anti-
gatekeeping), and DSA (platform transparency).
The Shift
Your progress becomes portable. Your skills become 
verifiable. Your data usage becomes transparent.
A foundation for a fair, open, player-centered ecosystem.

SOCIAL IMPACT
We shift the paradigm 
from extraction to 
empowerment.
Economic Mobility
We translate gameplay behavior into soft-skill indicators and 
competency signals 4 opening employment and education 
pathways for underrepresented youth.
Digital Dignity
Players gain meaningful control over their identity and how AI 
systems train on their behavior.
Open Innovation
We democratize ethical data access, enabling European studios 
and startups to compete with global giants.

THE MOMENT IS NOW
Why Now & Why WAC
Regulatory Momentum
The Data Act, DMA, DSA, and the AI Act all push toward 
interoperability, transparency, and user-controlled data 4 
exactly what PlayGraph operationalizes.
Cultural Timing
Gaming has overtaken social networks as the primary 
identity space for youth. The next decade of digital 
citizenship will be built here.
Why WAC
WAC champions digital rights, youth 
empowerment, and inclusion.
GameScrobbler is the infrastructure that brings 
those values to life.
Together, we can 
make gaming the 
first global 
ecosystem where 
users truly own 
who they are
