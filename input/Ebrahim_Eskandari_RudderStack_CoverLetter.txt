Dear Hiring Team at RudderStack,
I’m writing to express my strong interest in the Senior Product Manager position at RudderStack.
Over the past decade, I’ve built and scaled data-centric SaaS products that bridge complex
infrastructure with elegant user and developer experiences. My background aligns closely with
RudderStack’s mission to redefine customer data infrastructure through open, developer-first
innovation.
As the founder of GameScrobbler, I’ve led the design of an API-first data platform that unifies
gameplay data from multiple ecosystems. This work required deep collaboration with engineering,
data governance, and developer tooling—very similar to RudderStack’s warehouse-native
approach. Before that, I co-founded Research On Mobile, which was later acquired by Riwi Corp,
where I served as VP & General Manager overseeing P&L;, product roadmap, and data pipeline
automation.
Across these roles, I’ve owned full product lifecycles, translated complex data flows into usable
APIs, and aligned cross-functional teams across design, engineering, and GTM. My goal has
always been to create tools that empower others to build and scale on top of reliable data
foundations—precisely what RudderStack stands for.
I’m inspired by your open-source and developer-first philosophy and would be thrilled to contribute
to scaling that vision. I’d welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience designing scalable
data infrastructure and customer-facing products could add value to your team.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
Best regards,
Ebrahim Eskandari
