The residency (aka 
cohort) is a 10+1-week 
sprint to build your 
company and raise your 
first investment. It takes 
place in Berlin. We work 
with you, get to know you, 
and prepare to invest in 
your company based on 
what we see during these 
weeks.
The first 6-weeks are all 
about finding your perfect 
co-founder match and 
developing a strong 
business idea to solve a 
real world challenge. First 
two weeks are crucial to 
be there in person to get 
to know your residency and 
the Antler team.

The teams are supported 
in developing, verifying, 
and building their 
businesses by high profile 
guests and a global 
network of 400+ advisors 
of industry experts, 
investment professionals 
and company builders.
