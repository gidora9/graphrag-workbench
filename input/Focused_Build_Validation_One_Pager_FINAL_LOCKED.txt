ONE-PAGER AGREEMENT – Focused Build & Validation Phase
Parties
Builder / Venture Architect: Ebrahim Eskandari
Sponsor / Venture Owner: Mojtaba (Arman) Bagheri
Purpose
A focused build and validation phase to rapidly design, build, and validate an operational engine
and MVP, enabling a clear decision on continuation. This is not a long-term co-founder or scaling
commitment unless mutually agreed.
Duration
3 months, extendable by mutual agreement.
Role & Commitment
Builder is 100% dedicated, executing fast with minimal oversight unless Sponsor chooses to be
involved. Sponsor provides direction and feedback as desired, without day-to-day execution
responsibility.
Compensation
$3,000 per month, fixed. Paid monthly. No revenue-linked component. Pre-approved expenses
reimbursed as agreed.
Scope
Build and validate the operational engine and MVP to a handover-ready, decision-ready state. No
obligation for long-term execution or scaling beyond this phase.
Upside & Exit
If the venture is incorporated, Builder receives 20% passive equity participation. Sponsor may
retain Builder as a passive shareholder or buy out the stake at a mutually agreed fair mechanism.
Intellectual Property
Venture-specific assets belong to the venture. General professional know-how, methods, and
frameworks remain reusable by the Builder.
End of Term
Clean handover. No ongoing obligations unless extended by mutual agreement.
