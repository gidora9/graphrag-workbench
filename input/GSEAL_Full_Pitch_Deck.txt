GSEAL – The Trust Layer for Competitive Gaming
- Platform-agnostic identity & verification layer
- Portable Seal Score: Play / Peer / Pay
- Authenticated competition without friction

Market Problem
- Smurfing, account sharing, banned-player evasion
- No cross-platform trusted identity layer
- High fraud rates in prize/payed tournaments
- Organizers spend hours manually verifying players

Why the Problem Persists
- Platforms choose low friction → no verification
- KYC-only solutions are too heavy for gamers
- Anti-cheat doesn’t solve identity integrity
- No portable reputation model across games

Solution: GSEAL
- Unified Seal Score combining 3 signals: Play / Peer / Pay
- Lightweight widget for platforms; minimal integration
- Players carry trust across all tournaments
- Organizers reduce manual policing to near-zero

Verification Layers
- Play-Proof: Game-linked data, performance consistency
- Peer-Proof: Community confirmations, organizer signals
- Pay-Proof: Fraud-safe identity for paid/prize events
- Weighted into a single portable Seal Score

Target Customers
- Tournament platforms (start.gg, Challonge, Toornament)
- Independent organizers running regular events
- Competitive players wanting verified environments
- Prize/paid-entry operators needing fraud reduction

Why Now
- Explosion of amateur competitive gaming
- Increasing financial incentives → increasing fraud
- Platforms lack resources to build verification internally
- GSEAL provides a neutral, ecosystem-wide layer

Business Model
- B2B platform licensing (usage-based)
- Organizer subscriptions & per-event fees
- Player Seal+ premium tier
- Pay-proof transaction validation fees

Competitive Advantage
- Not KYC, not a passport → frictionless & game-native
- Portable trust layer across all platforms
- Multi-signal identity model unique in the market
- Founder history building large-scale verification systems

Go-To-Market Strategy
- Start with lightweight frontend widget demos
- Target high-pain organizers (paid/prize tournaments)
- Secure first platform integration → seal standardization
- Expand into mid-size & enterprise platforms

Traction & Validation
- Validated with tournament organizers & players
- Strong demand for reducing smurfing & cheating
- Clear willingness to adopt a frictionless trust layer
- Technical feasibility validated by engineering team

Roadmap – Next 90 Days
- Build verification widget & Seal Score prototype
- Close first platform integration
- Launch with first 10+ organizers
- Reach 500–1,000 verified players
