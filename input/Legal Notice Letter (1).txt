Dear Mr. Kobeissi,

tohimfollowingyourbusinessseparation. ThemutuallyagreeddeadlineofDecember31,
2025, has passed without resolution.
1. SETTLEMENT PROPOSAL
To resolve this amicably, we require a concrete proposal for the transfer of the withheld
funds ($300,000.00 USD). We are extending a final grace period untilJanuary 22, 2026.
2. IMPLICATIONS
We prefer to settle this privately. However, continued non-compliance will compel us to
review the full scope of your professional history, including the circumstances of your de-
partures from previous associations, to establish a pattern of conduct.
We trust you appreciate the value of resolving this liability discreetly to prevent enforce-
mentmeasuresfromimpactingyourcurrentprofessionalengagementsorstandinginthe

3. CONCLUSION
If a satisfactory response is not received by the deadline, my client has instructed me to
initiate formal recovery steps immediately.
Govern yourself accordingly,
