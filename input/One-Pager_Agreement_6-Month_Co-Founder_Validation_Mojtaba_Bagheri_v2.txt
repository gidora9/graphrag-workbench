ONE-PAGER AGREEMENT
6-Month Co-Founder Validation Phase
Parties
Co-Founder A (Venture Architect): Ebrahim Eskandari
Co-Founder B (Partner): Mojtaba (Arman) Bagheri
Purpose
We agree to work together for six (6) months to explore, test, and validate a new venture idea, with the
goal of gaining clarity quickly on whether it is worth continuing. This phase is focused on validation and
learning, not long-term execution.
Roles
Co-Founder A — Venture Architect
• Leads validation and experimentation
• Designs and runs short, fast tests to check key assumptions
• Decides what to test, how to test it, and when to move on
• Shares learnings, patterns, and recommendations regularly
Co-Founder B — Partner
• Contributes ideas, intuition, network, and experience
• Suggests directions or opportunities worth exploring
• Participates in discussions as evidence emerges
How Decisions Are Made
• Ideas may come from either side
• Design and execution of tests sit with Co-Founder A
• Direction is discussed jointly
• Evidence matters more than opinions
Duration & Continuity
This collaboration runs for six (6) months. At the end of the six-month period, if both co-founders
mutually agree to continue, the collaboration proceeds jointly. If there is no mutual agreement to
continue, Co-Founder B may choose to continue the venture independently.
Compensation
• €3,500 per month paid to Co-Founder A
• Up to €500 per month for pre-approved expenses
• Paid monthly, upfront
Appendix (Reference Only)

An Appendix is attached describing the current business idea, initial business model, and an indicative
validation roadmap. The Appendix reflects current thinking only, is non-binding, and may change based
on learnings during the validation phase.
Shared Understanding
This phase is about buying clarity fast, not forcing a business to exist.
