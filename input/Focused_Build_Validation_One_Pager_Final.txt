ONE-PAGER AGREEMENT – Focused Build & Validation Phase
Parties
Builder / Venture Architect: Ebrahim Eskandari
Sponsor / Venture Owner: Mojtaba (Arman) Bagheri
What We’re Doing
A focused build and validation phase to quickly design, build, and test a working operational engine
and MVP, with the goal of reaching a clear, decision-ready point. This is not a long-term co-founder
or scaling commitment unless mutually agreed later.
Duration
3 months, starting upon agreement, extendable by mutual agreement.
How We’ll Work Together
Builder is fully dedicated during this phase, driving execution end-to-end with speed and ownership,
working independently day-to-day while staying aligned, and delivering a handover-ready setup.
Sponsor may be involved as much or as little as desired and is not required for day-to-day
execution.
Compensation
$3,000 per month, fixed. Paid monthly. No revenue-linked components. Pre-approved expenses
reimbursed as agreed.
Scope
Build and validate the core operational engine and MVP, establishing a setup that can be taken
forward independently. No obligation for long-term execution or scaling beyond this phase.
Upside & Continuation
If the venture is incorporated, Builder receives 20% passive, non-operational equity participation.
Sponsor may retain Builder as a passive shareholder or buy out the stake using a fair, mutually
agreed mechanism.
Intellectual Property
All venture-specific assets, implementations, materials, and industry-related intellectual property
(including birth tourism, citizenship, residency, immigration, and related agency models) remain the
property of the venture. Builder retains the unrestricted right to reuse general professional
know-how, methods, frameworks, systems, and experience, provided they are not used to directly
replicate or compete with the venture.
End of Phase
Clean handover of all venture materials. No ongoing obligations unless both parties agree to
continue under new terms.
Shared Understanding
This phase prioritizes momentum, clarity, and execution. If it works well, next steps can be
discussed; otherwise, both parties part cleanly and with respect.
