ONE-PAGER AGREEMENT
Focused Build & Validation Phase
Parties
Builder / Venture Architect: Ebrahim Eskandari
Sponsor / Venture Owner: Mojtaba (Arman) Bagheri
Purpose
We agree to work together for a focused build and validation phase to design, build, and test a working operational
engine and MVP, with the goal of gaining clarity quickly on whether it is worth continuing. The MVP is intended to
be commercially usable, meaning suitable for gauging real market response and, where possible, generating early
revenue signals without delaying execution.
Roles — Builder / Venture Architect
1
Leads execution end-to-end with speed and ownership
2
Designs, builds, and iterates the operational engine and MVP
3
Works independently day-to-day while staying aligned
4
Delivers a handover-ready setup by the end of the phase
Roles — Sponsor / Venture Owner
1
Provides direction, intuition, and feedback as desired
2
May be involved as much or as little as preferred
3
Is not required for day-to-day execution
How Decisions Are Made
1
Ideas may originate from either party
2
Design and execution sit with the Builder
3
Direction and interpretation are discussed jointly
4
Evidence and learnings outweigh opinions
Start Date & Duration
Start Date: January 1
Duration: 3 months, starting from the Start Date, extendable by mutual agreement.
Compensation
1
$3,000 per month paid to the Builder
2
Paid monthly
3
Pre-approved expenses reimbursed as agreed
Upside & Continuation
If the venture is incorporated, the Builder receives 20% passive, non-operational equity participation. If the parties
mutually agree to continue, the collaboration will move forward based on what has been built and learned, under
terms to be agreed at that time.
Intellectual Property
All venture-specific assets, implementations, materials, and industry-related intellectual property (including but not
limited to birth tourism, citizenship, residency, immigration, and related agency models) remain the property of the
venture. The Builder retains the unrestricted right to reuse general professional know-how, methods, frameworks,
systems, and experience, provided they are not used to directly replicate or compete with the venture.

Shared Understanding
This phase is about buying clarity fast and maintaining momentum, not forcing a business to exist. If it works well,
next steps can be discussed; otherwise, both parties part cleanly and with respect.
