ONE-PAGER AGREEMENT
Focused Build & Validation Phase
Parties
Builder / Venture Architect: Ebrahim Eskandari
Sponsor / Venture Owner: Mojtaba (Arman) Bagheri
What We’re Doing
A focused build and validation phase to design, build, and test a working operational engine and
MVP, with the goal of reaching a clear, decision-ready point. The MVP is intended to be
commercially usable, meaning suitable for gauging real market response and, where possible,
generating early revenue signals without delaying execution.
Start Date & Duration
Start Date: January 1
Duration: 3 months, starting from the Start Date, extendable by mutual agreement.
How We’ll Work Together
The Builder is fully dedicated during this phase, driving execution end-to-end with speed and
ownership, working independently on a day-to-day basis while staying aligned, and delivering a
handover-ready setup by the end of the phase. The Sponsor may be involved as much or as little
as desired and is not required for day-to-day execution.
Compensation
$3,000 per month, fixed.
Paid monthly.
No revenue-linked components.
Pre-approved expenses reimbursed as agreed.
Scope
Build and validate the core operational engine and MVP, establishing a setup that can be taken
forward independently.
Upside & Continuation
If the venture is incorporated, the Builder receives 20% passive, non-operational equity
participation. If the parties mutually agree to continue, the collaboration will move forward based on
what has been built and learned, under terms to be agreed at that time. The Sponsor may retain the
Builder as a passive shareholder or buy out the stake using a fair, mutually agreed mechanism.
Intellectual Property
All venture-specific assets, implementations, materials, and industry-related intellectual property
(including but not limited to birth tourism, citizenship, residency, immigration, and related agency
models) remain the property of the venture. The Builder retains the unrestricted right to reuse
general professional know-how, methods, frameworks, systems, and experience gained during the
engagement, provided they are not used to directly replicate or compete with the venture.
End of Phase
A clean handover of all venture materials will be completed.
Shared Understanding
This phase prioritizes momentum, clarity, and execution. If it works well, next steps can be
discussed; otherwise, both parties part cleanly and with respect.
