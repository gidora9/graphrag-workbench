" The gift of presence is a luxury for the development and expansion of one's, own meaning within their 
reality, a reality that is ordered and structured by a series of vast complexities of its modern momentum 
and  consumption. Each  momentum  requires  an  optimized  subjective  and  objective  foundation  and 
operations.  Hence  each  meaningful  moment  is  unique  to  its  own and its  resources  that way to their 
desired reality and the context of its beholders. 
The excellence of such a spectrum and domain is what we stand for and the name Brand Protocol, is the 
pure  definition  of  uniqueness  of  thought,  process,  measurement,  result  and  profitability  for  each  brand. 
We hope that you would join us in changing the world and its realities to a more beautiful and profitable 
place for every one "

"Try not to become a man of success. Rather become a man of value."

serving and  enhancing    businesses, entrepreneurs,  organizations  and  individuals  in  their

narratives with in all of its thought patterns and operations. We believe that branding simply 
is the scientifically implementing of  an  articulate foundation  for presenting  and sustaining  a 
specific meaning for a time and place . 
The service brands core is induce with over 12 years of experience with a variety of business, 
technical  , statistical  specialist's  in  the  field  of  commerce,  branding,  marketing  ,  sales, 
advertising, management and etc (i.e ranging from digital to physical environment), with the 
goal of enhancing the understanding of markets, cultures, policies, operations, success points,

on  investment  for  the  Iranian  market  and  to  offer  services  that  range  from  market,  brand

What We Do ?  
Brand  Protocol's  operations  and  services  are  designed  based  on  the  experiences  gathered 
from  customers  needs  and requirements to  business  success  factors  and  specialist's  insight  , 
foresight and future emergence of market desirability, we have strived to mix and intertwine 
academia with  industry  and  their  respected  customer interactions .  Hence  our  offerings    can 
be addressed in three main categories: 

 
 
1- Consulting and Coaching on Business Oriented Services : 
In todays competitive environment and business desirability , many companies and business 
want   to   be   aware   or   their   potential   operations   and   want   to   be   in   control   of   their 
competitiveness and success, thus success is an ongoing phenomenon that is contentious and 
must  be  in  the  hands of  the  business  them  selves  ,  hence  one  of  our  main  approaches  to 
conducting  the  later  stated  services  is  based  on  coaching  the  business  rather  then  consulting 
for them .  
On  the  other  hand, many  other  companies  prefer  to  be  only  consulted  in  a  specified issue  , 
which  again  can  be  conducted  with  our  methodology  of  scientific  analysis  and  quantitative 
realization of their dilemma . 
Hence , our services can be stated as bellow:

2-Developing Business Oriented Dashboards : 
Due  to  the  main  reason  for  Brand  Protocol's existence,  which  is  striving  towards  business 
excellence,  one  can  state  that  one  of  the  main  issues  towards  achieving  such  a  goal  is 
effective and optimum decision making.  
We at Brand Protocol strive to induce such decision making by developing online dashboards 
for our clients for them to make their own decisions and effective choices for their business 
success.  
Our  dashboards  are  based  on  quantitative, statistical  and  computational  integration  and  also 
based on our services and the requirements of our clients.  
For  example,  a  client  might  want  to the  relationship  between  sales  activities  and  the  profits 
gained  for  their  respected  segments and  at  the  same  time  to  know  what  decision  they  can 
make  towards  their  inventory  strategies  and  what  the  overall  return  on their  segment 
investment is ? We can provide such analytics and solutions for our prominent clients.  
3-Training and Education on Business Oriented Issues: 
  At  Brand  Protocol  ,  we  believe  in  contentious  mental  and  skill  growth  ,  hence  we  are 
prepared  to  offer  effective  courses  and  training  for either  the  relevant  consulting/coaching's 
that  we  provide  or  specialized  and  more  focused  courses  in  Business  sphere  from  internal
