PRELIMINARY PROPOSAL 
 
To: Pureprofile Leadership 
From:  
Ebrahim Eskandari
Date: December 1, 2025 
Subject: Strategic Evolution: The Predictive Ecosystem & Trust Pyramid 
1. Executive Summary: Breaking the 
Efficiency Ceiling 
The market research industry is approaching a structural limit. Traditional 
panels are facing feasibility challenges (finding unique users), while the 
programmatic alternative—legacy routing—is plagued by integration fatigue, 
high screen-out rates, and diminishing returns. 
 
The Thesis: We cannot "route" our way out of this efficiency gap. We must 
predict our way out. 
 
This proposal outlines a strategic evolution for Pureprofile: shifting from 
Reactive Routing to Proactive Prediction. By adopting a "Direct-to-Source" 
architecture, we can unlock massive pools of fresh traffic and automatically 
convert them into a high-fidelity "Trust Panel" with zero overlap against legacy 
pools. 

2. The Architecture: The "Trust 
Pyramid" 
We propose moving away from the binary concept of "Panelist vs. 
Non-Panelist." Instead, the ecosystem should function as a dynamic refining 
funnel. We capture mass volume at the base and surface the gold at the top. 
 
Layer 1 The River F resh Supply): We tap into direct mobile inventory 
Apps/Games) to access millions of users who never join traditional 
panels. We engage them with zero-friction, transactional micro-surveys. 
Layer 2 The Talent Scout AI Filter): Automated behavioral intelligence 
identifies stable, attentive respondents in real-time based on consistency 
and input velocity. 
Layer 3 The Gold Standard The Truth Set): The top 1% are 
automatically promoted to a Premium Verified Tier Go vernmental ID + 
Monthly Retainer). This creates a defensible, fraud-resistant calibration 
set. 
 
 
3. The Engine: Prediction > Routing 
Current technology asks: "Does this user fit the survey?" R esult: 
Screen-out/Bad UX. The new model asks: "Which survey fits this user?" 
R esult: Match/Yield). 
 

● Supply Path Optimization SPO We eliminate intermediaries and go 
Direct Server-to-Server S2S. This allows us to read key predictive 
signals De vice, Geo, Spend, Behavior) before the bid. 
● The Zero Screen-Out Protocol: Our AI predicts the match probability 
before the interrupt. If the likelihood is < 90%, the user is never pinged. 
● Result: We stop wasting inventory on users destined to screen out, 
drastically improving Publisher retention and Unit Economics. 
 
4. Strategic Business Impact 
This is not an incremental upgrade; it is a systemic shift that delivers three 
specific competitive advantages: 
 
1. Net-New Reach: Direct mobile supply taps into "River" respondents 
invisible to standard aggregators. This becomes Pureprofileʼs proprietary 
"Fresh Reservoir." 
2. Quality Moat: The Pyramid architecture creates a continuously 
improving "Truth Set"—a living, validated human cohort that trains and 
calibrates the entire ecosystem. 
3. Feasibility at Speed: Predictive Matching fills quotas faster. We only buy 
what we can sell. 
5. Preliminary Roadmap & Next Steps 
I propose a phased approach to exploring this architecture to ensure it aligns 
with Pureprofileʼs current infrastructure and product goals. 
 
Phase Objective Outcome 
Phase 1 The "One Mediator" 
Audit Discovery) 
Assess the current supply chain to identify where 
"middleman tax" (aggregators) can be removed in 
favor of direct inventory. 
A roadmap to consolidate supply logic into a single 
predictive gateway. 
Phase 2 The "Smart Ping" 
Pilot Pr oof of Concept) 
A low-risk test on a single high-volume supply 
stream. 
Implement the "Predictive Match" logic to measure the 
lift in yield, match rate, and quality compared to legacy 
routing. 
 

Discussion: I would welcome the opportunity to walk you through the 
architectural diagrams and discuss how a pilot program could be scoped for Q1 
2026.
