ABOUT
I am a product executive with a proven record of scaling complex platforms into measurable
revenue growth.
Most recently at RIWI Corp, I built and scaled a new respondent marketplace from zero to $2M
ARR in 12 months, owning the full P&L;, product strategy, and go-to-market execution. I
transformed fragmented manual processes into scalable products, optimized supply and demand
operations, and led a cross-functional team across product, engineering, and growth to create a
repeatable growth engine.
Before that, as Co-Founder and COO of Research on Mobile, I helped grow the company to over
$2.5M in revenue and played a central role in its successful acquisition by RIWI. Across both
ventures, I consistently bridged business strategy, technology, and data to deliver real commercial
impact.
Today, I am building Game Scrobbler, a unified gaming analytics platform designed to help
developers turn raw player data into actionable insights. I treat it as a strategic side venture while
actively pursuing my next full-time leadership role.
Core strengths:
• Building and scaling SaaS and marketplace platforms from zero to growth stage
• Owning P&L; and aligning product strategy directly with revenue outcomes
• Leading distributed, cross-functional teams across product, engineering, and operations
• Turning complex data systems into simple, high-value customer experiences
• Driving disciplined go-to-market execution and operational efficiency
I am currently open to senior product leadership roles—including Product Lead, Head of Product,
Director of Product Management, or General Manager positions—where I can help organizations
scale products, teams, and revenue.
I bring an entrepreneurial mindset, structured execution, and a bias toward measurable
results—and I am ready for the next challenge.
