Build Trust Infrastructure Into
500K Monthly Tournaments
GamerSeal Partnership Proposal for Challengermode
GamerSealChallengermode
Prepared for Robel Efrem, CEO, Challengermode
November 2025

THE OPPORTUNITY YOU'VE BUILT
Challengermode: Leading the Democratization of
Competitive Gaming
Challengermode has achieved what few platforms have: true scale with
500,000 tournaments per month across PC, console, and mobile. Your mission
to "make esports accessible to all" has succeeded—you've built the
infrastructure that powers competitive gaming from grassroots to enterprise.
Your recent partnerships validate this leadership: Madden Championship Series
(EA Sports), BLAST R6 (Rainbow Six Siege), and Brawlhalla (Ubisoft, April
2025). These publishers chose Challengermode because you deliver scale,
accessibility, and community engagement.
But scale creates a new challenge: trust doesn't scale the same
way infrastructure does.

THE PROBLEM
The Trust Crisis Threatening Your Growth

For Publishers
Integrity issues damage brand reputation and reduce player
engagement. EA, Ubisoft, and Riot face constant community backlash
over smurfing and boosting in their competitive ecosystems.

For Organizers
Smurfing complaints drive away legitimate players and reduce repeat
tournaments. Manual review doesn't scale—organizers spend hours
investigating suspicious accounts.

For Players
Unfair competition leads to churn and negative community sentiment.
Players abandon tournaments when they face obvious smurfs or
boosted accounts.

For Challengermode
Trust issues limit publisher partnerships and premium monetization. At
500,000 tournaments/month, this isn't minor—it's an existential threat to
growth.
Current Solutions Don't Work at Your Scale
✗ Manual Review
Doesn't scale to 500K tournaments/month. Would
require hundreds of moderators reviewing accounts
24/7.
✗ Document ID Verification
Expensive, slow, privacy concerns, wrong signal.
Identity ≠ behavior. Verified person can still smurf or
boost.
✗ Platform-Specific Verification
Doesn't transfer across games or platforms. Player
verified in Valorant isn't automatically trusted in R6
or Madden.

THE SOLUTION
GamerSeal: Behavioral Trust Infrastructure That Scales
GamerSeal solves the trust crisis with automated behavioral trust infrastructure—not document verification, not manual review, but
automated analysis of gaming behavior that proves player authenticity.
HOW IT WORKS: THREE PROOF PATHS

1. Pair Proof
Player links gaming accounts (Steam, Epic,
Riot, Xbox, PlayStation). GamerSeal verifies
account ownership and cross-platform
consistency.
Prevents multi-accounting and throwaway
accounts

2. Peer Proof
Analyzes competitive history: tournaments
played, teammates, opponents. Validates
skill level consistency.
Detects sandbagging, boosting, and skill
inconsistency

3. Pay Proof
Reviews in-game purchases, tournament
entries, subscription history. Confirms
account legitimacy and investment.
Separates serious players from disposable
accounts

THE SOLUTION (CONTINUED)
GamerSeal Output: Seal Tiers and Key Benefits
OUTPUT: SEAL TIER
●
Bronze Seal
●
Silver Seal
●
Gold Seal
Why This Works
✓
Automated: Scales to 500K tournaments without manual review
✓
Behavioral: Analyzes what players DO, not who they claim to be
✓
Cross-Platform: Single Seal works across all games on Challengermode
✓
Privacy-Friendly: No document uploads, GDPR-compliant, EU-native

TECHNICAL INTEGRATION
Perfect Technical Fit: Your Game Linking API
Challengermode already has the technical foundation GamerSeal needs: your game account linking API. This makes integration faster,
cleaner, and more powerful than any other platform.

Your Competitive Advantage: Challonge doesn't have game account linking → GamerSeal must build from scratch. Battlefy has closed API →
GamerSeal can't integrate without partnership. Challengermode has open game linking API → GamerSeal integrates cleanly.

PREMIUM MONETIZATION
Sealed Club: Premium Tournament Tier
Sealed Club is GamerSeal's premium tournament tier that creates exclusive brackets for verified players. Organizers can require
minimum Seal tiers (Bronze/Silver/Gold) to ensure fair competition, while players pay premium entry fees for guaranteed smurf-free
tournaments.
How Sealed Club Works
1
Organizer Creates
Requires minimum Seal tier
(Bronze/Silver/Gold). Only sealed players
can register. Premium positioning:
"Verified Fair Play Tournament"
2
Players Join
Get verified once, access all Sealed Club
tournaments. Separate bracket from
unverified players. Higher quality
competition, less smurfing.
3
Premium Pricing
Verified tournaments charge 20-30%
higher entry fees. Players willing to pay
for fair competition. Challengermode
earns 10% of higher fees.

verification. No biometric data, no personal information storage.

Privacy-First
No document uploads, no identity verification. Players retain ownership of
gaming data and can request deletion anytime.

EU Hosting
GamerSeal uses EU data centers for European players. Data never leaves
EU jurisdiction.

struggle with GDPR compliance, you offer a native solution built for
EU players and organizers.
Trust and privacy are top concerns for EU players. GamerSeal
positions Challengermode as the platform that takes both seriously.

BUSINESS MODEL
Three Partnership Models to Choose From
1
RECOMMENDED
Platform Licensing
STRUCTURE
Challengermode pays GamerSeal fixed
monthly license fee
FEE
€1,000-2,000/month (negotiable based on
volume)
Challengermode Monetization: Add Seal
as premium feature in organizer tiers (€5-
10/tournament add-on) or include in
premium subscription (€50/month)
ADVANTAGES
2
Revenue Share
STRUCTURE
GamerSeal takes percentage of organizer
fees from Seal feature
SPLIT
20% GamerSeal / 10% Challengermode /
70% Organizer
Example: Organizer pays €100 for Sealed
Club tournament → GamerSeal: €20,
Challengermode: €10, Organizer: €70
ADVANTAGES
3
Hybrid
STRUCTURE
Small fixed fee + revenue share
TERMS
€500/month + 10% revenue share (instead
of 20%)
Example: €500 base + €10 per €100
tournament fee = €500 + (usage × 10%)
ADVANTAGES
Predictable fixed cost
•
Keep all organizer revenue
•
Simple accounting
•
Full control of pricing
•
No upfront cost
•

BUSINESS MODEL (CONTINUED)
Recommended Partnership Terms
WHY MODEL 1 (PLATFORM LICENSING)
1
Simple & Predictable
Fixed monthly cost makes budgeting easy. No complex revenue tracking
or split calculations.
2
Keep All Organizer Revenue
Charge organizers €5-10/tournament or include in premium tiers. 100%
of organizer fees stay with Challengermode.
3
Full Pricing Control
Set your own pricing strategy without revenue share constraints. Test
different models freely.
4
Pilot De-Risks Investment
6-month pilot at €1K/month proves value before scaling to €2K/month.
Cancel anytime if not satisfied.

COMPETITIVE POSITIONING
Competitive Comparison: Scale, Trust & Market Position
Battlefy dominates team esports with 150K+ organizers but lacks trust infrastructure. Toornament (Matthieu Dallon's platform) has basic
account linking but no behavioral verification. Challengermode + GamerSeal combines scale, trust, and EU positioning—a unique
competitive advantage.

COMPETITIVE POSITIONING (CONTINUED)
Your Unique Competitive Advantage

YOUR UNIQUE POSITION
Only Challengermode combines massive scale (500K/month) + automated trust infrastructure (GamerSeal) + EU
market positioning (GDPR-compliant). Battlefy has scale but no trust. Toornament has EU positioning but no
behavioral verification. You have both.
STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS

Publisher Pitch Advantage
Single platform offering: EA, Ubisoft,
and BLAST want both scale AND trust.
Challengermode + GamerSeal delivers
both in one partnership. Battlefy can
only offer scale. Toornament can only
offer EU compliance.

Premium Positioning
Sealed Club differentiates: Battlefy's
basic brackets are commoditized.
Challengermode's verified tournaments
command 20-30% premium pricing.
Players pay more for guaranteed fair
competition, organizers earn more per
tournament.

EU Market Leadership
Regulatory advantage: GDPR
compliance + behavioral trust (no
document uploads) = future-proof. As
EU tightens data regulations,
Challengermode's Sweden-based
infrastructure + privacy-friendly
verification becomes a moat.

SOCIAL PROOF
Trust Esport Validation: Matthieu Dallon
Matthieu Dallon
Founder & CEO, Trust Esport
Why this matters: Matthieu understands tournament platforms
better than anyone. He built Toornament from scratch and knows
exactly what organizers need. His validation of GamerSeal's Sealed
Club model carries significant weight.
THE PROBLEM HE'S SOLVING
Trust Esport faces the same challenge Challengermode does:
how to ensure competitive integrity at scale without manual
review. Matthieu sees GamerSeal as the infrastructure solution.
