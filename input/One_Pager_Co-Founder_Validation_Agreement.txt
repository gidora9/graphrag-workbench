ONE-PAGER AGREEMENT
6-Month Co-Founder Validation Phase
Parties
Co-Founder A (Venture Architect): Ebrahim Eskandari
Co-Founder B (Partner): Mojtaba (Arman) Bagheri
Purpose
We agree to work together for six (6) months to explore, test, and validate a new venture idea, with the goal of
gaining clarity quickly on whether it is worth continuing. This phase is focused on validation and learning, not
long-term execution or scaling.
Roles — Co-Founder A (Venture Architect)
• Leads validation and experimentation
• Designs and runs short, fast tests to check key assumptions
• Decides what to test, how to test it, and when to move on
• Shares learnings, patterns, and recommendations on an ongoing basis
Roles — Co-Founder B (Partner)
• Contributes ideas, intuition, network, and experience
• Suggests directions or opportunities worth exploring
• Participates in discussions as evidence emerges
How Decisions Are Made
• Ideas may originate from either co-founder
• Design and execution of validation tests sit with Co-Founder A
• Direction and interpretation of results are discussed jointly
• Evidence and learnings outweigh opinions
Duration, Continuity & Ownership
This collaboration runs for six (6) months.
If the parties mutually agree to continue, the venture will proceed under new terms with an agreed founding
ownership split of:
40% — Co-Founder A
60% — Co-Founder B
If there is no mutual decision to continue jointly, the collaboration ends automatically and Co-Founder B may
choose to continue the venture independently.
Compensation
• €3,500 per month paid to Co-Founder A
• Up to €500 per month for pre-approved expenses
• Paid monthly, upfront
Appendix (Reference Only)

An Appendix describing the current business idea, initial business model, and an indicative validation roadmap
is attached for reference only and may evolve based on learnings.
Shared Understanding
This phase is about buying clarity fast, not forcing a business to exist.
