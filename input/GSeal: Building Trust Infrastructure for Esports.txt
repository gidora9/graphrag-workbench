GSEAL
Building Trust Infrastructure for Esports
Strategic Validation & Execution Plan
Presented for Farzad • October 31, 2025

From B2C Product to B2B
Infrastructure Layer
ORIGINAL VISION
Direct-to-consumer gamer verification with individual user
acquisition as a standalone product.
NEW STRATEGY
Backend service for tournament platforms where partnerships
drive distribution through white-label API integration.
Built-in distribution through platforms eliminates costly B2C
acquisition. Predictable B2B SaaS revenue model enables recurring
monthly income.

Multi-Accounting and Fraud are Recognized
Problems
Enterprise solutions validate demand, but 95% of tournaments lack affordable
verification

GSeal Differentiates Through
Community-Powered Trust
Method
Enterprise: Biometric + Government ID
GSeal: Peer Vouching + Gameplay Data
Cost
Enterprise: $2-5 per verification
GSeal: $0.25-0.50 per verification
User Friction
Enterprise: High (selfie + ID upload)
GSeal: Low (peer endorsement)
Target Market
Enterprise: High-stakes, regulated
GSeal: Mid-tier, community events
Don't compete with Daon/Aware for enterprise. Own the mid-
tier segment they ignore.

Flat Licensing Beats Per-Player Pricing
Sustainable unit economics with predictable B2B SaaS revenue model
BASIC
$500
per month
PRO
$1,000
per month
ENTERPRISE
$2,000+
per month
3 platforms × $1,000/month = $3,000 MRR by Month 6
Infrastructure costs <$300/month = 90% gross margin

Toornament's Modular
Architecture Enables Native
Integration
1. EXPLICIT MODULAR DESIGN
Developer API tier (€590/month) built for third-party integrations
with white-label support and custom registration processes.
2. PROVEN BUNDLE MODEL
Already sells add-ons like Tournament Boost (€19/tournament).
Tiered pricing from Free → €19 → €69/month → €590/month.
3. PARTNERSHIP PRECEDENT
Ubisoft Nadeo white-label case study proves enterprise
collaboration capability.
GSeal can become a native add-on in Toornament's
ecosystem, bundled as "Verified Tournament" package at
€99/month (€69 + €30).

Focus 80% of Effort on Toornament
Platform prioritization based on modular architecture, partnership
readiness, and integration complexity
PRIORITY 1 • PRIMARY TARGET
Toornament
9/10FIT SCORE
Modular architecture with Developer API tier, bundle-ready pricing model, partnership
precedent with Ubisoft white-label

Secondary and deprioritized targets with strategic rationale
PRIORITY 2 • SECONDARY TARGET

plugin marketplace

PRIORITY 3 • DEPRIORITIZED
Start.gg
Microsoft-owned with likely internal solutions, no visible partner ecosystem, API focused on
data extraction

Success Hinges on Platform Adoption
Three critical risks with mitigation strategies
RISK 1: PLATFORM ADOPTION
60%
Platforms may resist integration due to dev
resources or skepticism about peer
vouching credibility.
MITIGATION
No-code CSV integration, free pilot with case study
commitment, white-label option, revenue share
model (70/30 split).
RISK 2: COLD START PROBLEM
90%
Peer vouching requires existing verified
users. Early tournaments have no vouchers
available.
MITIGATION
Manually seed 100-200 verified users per platform,
automate $5 fast-track via third-party ID API,
gameplay-based auto-verification.
RISK 3: TRUST CEILING
50%
Peer vouching may be perceived as less
credible than biometric verification by
sponsors and high-stakes organizers.
MITIGATION
Tiered seals: Bronze (1 vouch), Silver (3 vouches
+ gameplay), Gold (biometric via partner API).

layer.

Clear Kill Switches Prevent Wasted Effort
Go/No-Go criteria with specific checkpoints to validate assumptions
GO CRITERIA
✓ Secure 1 pilot partnership by Week 4
✓ Can build MVP within 2 weeks
✓ Can manually verify 100-200 seed users
✓ Comfortable with $5K-10K investment for 3-month pilot
NO-GO TRIGGERS
✗ 0 interested platforms after 10+ outreach attempts by Week 4
✗ Technical execution requires >$20K investment
✗ Regulatory research reveals imminent KYC mandates
✗ Competitor launches identical offering before pilot
WEEK 4
1
pilot partnership secured
WEEK 8
500
verified users in pilot
MONTH 2
1
paying partner (pilot converts)

Validate Demand Before Building
Outreach first, build second. Confirm platform interest before committing development resources.
WEEKS 1-2
Validate
Outreach to Toornament,
Challengermode, Battlefy
Create landing page + LinkedIn ads
Competitor deep dive
WEEKS 3-4
Build MVP
CSV upload/download (no-code
integration)
OAuth + peer vouch + fast-track
queue
Admin panel for manual verification
WEEKS 5-6
Pilot
White-glove service for first pilot
partner
Track metrics: verification rate, fraud
reports
Document case study
WEEKS 7-8
Iterate or Pivot
If pilot succeeds: Onboard 2nd
partner, refine pricing
If pilot fails: Post-mortem, pivot or
shut down

24% Success Probability is Typical for B2B SaaS
60% × 40% = 24%
Secure 1 pilot partner (Week 4) × Convert to paying (Month 2) = Overall success probability
IF SUCCESSFUL
$3,000 MRR by Month 6
3 platforms × $1,000/month
$10,000 MRR by Month 12
10 platforms × $1,000/month
Network effects accelerate as verified player database becomes
competitive moat
IF UNSUCCESSFUL
Pivot 1: Direct-to-organizer SaaS (bypass platforms)
Pivot 2: Verification API for broader esports apps
Pivot 3: Fraud detection analytics play
Pivot 4: Acquisition target (sell verified player database)
Stripe, Twilio, and Plaid all faced similar odds in their early stages. B2B SaaS requires multiple attempts to find product-market
fit. The key is setting clear kill switches to avoid sunk cost fallacy.

Conditional Go – Proceed with
Cautious Optimism
WHY THIS STRATEGY WORKS
Validated market problem, underserved mid-tier segment,
differentiated peer vouching approach, lean cost structure, and
Toornament's modular architecture as natural fit.
EXECUTION RISKS
Platform adoption uncertain (60% risk), cold start requires
manual effort, trust ceiling may limit upside, competitive moat
weak initially.
RECOMMENDATION
Proceed with pilot, but validate at every step. Week 4: 1 pilot
partnership or pivot. Week 8: 500 verified users or reassess.
Month 2: 1 paying customer or pivot.
