IIM — International Intelligence for Mobility Business
Model & Partnership Brief
Executive Summary
IIM (International Intelligence for Mobility) is a decision-intelligence company operating at the
intersection of global mobility, citizenship law, and geopolitical risk. IIM provides non-executable,
corridor-level intelligence that helps families and advisors understand the risk-adjusted reality of
irreversible cross-border life decisions.
The Problem
Families face severe information asymmetry when making high-stakes mobility decisions. Existing
actors are incentive-conflicted and optimized for execution rather than restraint, leading to regret,
legal exposure, and long-term compliance risk.
The IIM Solution
IIM delivers neutral intelligence through corridor-based analysis. It does not facilitate immigration,
birth logistics, or legal execution. The platform prioritizes downside analysis, volatility, and failure
modes.

Defensibility

IIM is defensible through structural independence, corridor memory, volatility tracking, and cultural
restraint. Trust is the primary moat.
Partnerships
IIM partners selectively with institutions that respect neutrality and long-term credibility. Lead
extraction and outcome-based compensation are explicitly refused.
Conclusion
IIM succeeds by preventing bad decisions, not by enabling more transactions. Authority and
survivability matter more than growth velocity.
