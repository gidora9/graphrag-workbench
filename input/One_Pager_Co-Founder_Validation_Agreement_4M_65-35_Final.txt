ONE-PAGER AGREEMENT
4-Month Co-Founder Validation Phase (Revised)
Start Date
1 January 2026
Parties
Co-Founder A (Venture Architect): Ebrahim Eskandari
Co-Founder B (Partner / Investor): Mojtaba (Arman) Bagheri
Purpose
We agree to work together for four (4) months to explore, test, and validate a specific venture idea, with the goal of
gaining clarity quickly on whether it is worth continuing.
This phase is focused on validation and learning, while aiming to build a commercially executable initial prototype.
Expected Outcome: During this phase, it is expected that the parties will create a functional MVP (Minimum Viable
Product) that is capable of revenue generation, even at an early stage.
Roles — Co-Founder A (Venture Architect)
• Leads validation and experimentation
• Designs and runs short, fast tests to check key assumptions
• Decides what to test, how to test it, and when to move on
• Shares learnings, patterns, and recommendations on an ongoing basis
• Works toward delivering an operational MVP with commercial potential
Roles — Co-Founder B (Partner / Investor)
• Contributes ideas, intuition, network, and experience
• Suggests directions or opportunities worth exploring
• Participates in discussions as evidence emerges
• Supports commercialization direction and market access when needed
How Decisions Are Made
• Ideas may originate from either co-founder
• Design and execution of validation tests sit with Co-Founder A
• Direction and interpretation of results are discussed jointly
• Evidence and learnings outweigh opinions
Duration, Continuity & Ownership
This collaboration runs for four (4) months.
If the parties mutually agree to continue, the venture will proceed under new terms with an agreed founding
ownership split of:
35% — Co-Founder A 65% — Co-Founder B
If there is no mutual decision to continue jointly, the collaboration ends automatically and Co-Founder B may
choose to continue the venture independently.
Use of Findings After Termination: In case of non-continuation, all findings, learnings, documentation, business
insights, validation results, and materials produced during this phase shall remain usable by Co-Founder B for
continuing or developing the venture independently.
Deliverables Ownership & Access: All deliverables created during the validation phase (documents, files, data,
accounts, branding, concepts) shall belong to the venture and remain accessible to Co-Founder B in case of
non-continuation.
Confidentiality (NDA Clause)
Both parties agree that during and after this collaboration, any business, technical, financial, operational,
client-related, strategic, or proprietary information shared or produced within this phase shall be treated as strictly
confidential.
Neither party may disclose, share, publish, or use confidential information outside of this project without prior
written consent from the other party, except where required by law.
This confidentiality obligation remains effective for two (2) years after the end of this agreement.

payment (Factura / Invoiced Payment)
