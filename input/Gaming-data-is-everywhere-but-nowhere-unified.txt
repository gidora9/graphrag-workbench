Gaming data is everywhere 4 
but nowhere unified
Players move seamlessly between Steam, PlayStation, Xbox, mobile, and 
PC. Each platform captures rich behavioral data 4 playtime, preferences, 
skill progression, social connections. Yet none of it connects. Every gaming 
session creates valuable insights that remain trapped in isolated 
ecosystems, invisible to the studios that could use them to create better 
experiences.

A valuable dataset that can't be used
Gameplay reveals how people think, learn, adapt, and 
collaborate under pressure. It's one of the richest behavioral 
datasets ever created. But studios struggle to personalize 
experiences or build meaningful player relationships because 
cross-platform behavior remains hidden in silos.
The result? Missed opportunities for deeper engagement, 
smarter design, and lasting player loyalty.

The data exists 4 the structure doesn't
Adaptive Difficulty
Dynamically adjust challenge based on true skill signals across 
games
Better Matchmaking
Create balanced experiences using cross-platform behavioral 
patterns
Player Insights
Understand motivations and preferences beyond single-game 
metrics
Retention Signals
Identify at-risk players before they churn using unified 
behavior data
Studios want these capabilities desperately. But fragmented data infrastructure makes unified player understanding nearly 
impossible to achieve at scale.

Introducing GameScrobbler
A simple behavioral identity layer
GameScrobbler unifies gameplay actions across every platform and converts them into rich behavioral embeddings. These 
embeddings create a PlayGraph 4 a persistent, cross-platform behavioral profile that travels with the player, not the platform.
One identity. Every gaming moment. Unified insights that finally make personalization possible.

What it enables for players and studios
Smarter Matchmaking
Pair players based on true 
behavioral fit, not just rank or 
playtime
Personalized Difficulty
Adjust challenge curves that respond 
to real player capability
Better Player Modeling
Build accurate profiles that capture 
cross-game behavior patterns
Competitive Integrity
Detect anomalies and smurfing with behavioral 
consistency checks
AI-Ready Insights
Train models on unified behavioral data for next-gen 
game design

Our growth has been entirely organic, driven by genuine player interest 
and word-of-mouth. We're supported by experienced advisors who 
believe in the vision and help us navigate the complex gaming ecosystem.

Experience forged under constraint
I previously built a $2M+ data company in one of the toughest 
environments for tech. Limited resources. Uncertain infrastructure. 
Constant adaptation required.
Those experiences shaped how I execute: resourceful, focused, and 
resilient. They taught me to validate quickly, build lean, and stay 
disciplined on what matters. That mindset helped attract a 
committed team around GameScrobbler who share the same 
values.

Why EWOR
Applying with clarity, not pressure
EWOR's focus on ambitious but grounded founders matches 
exactly where we are 4 moving from early traction to 
building something with long-term impact.
We're not chasing hype. We're solving a real infrastructure 
problem that gets more valuable as gaming becomes more 
distributed. We need partners who understand patient, 
strategic growth.

Thank you
Excited for the chance to build this next chapter together.
