1. WHAT EXPERIENCE DOES YOUR COMPANY HAVE IN PROVIDING ONLINE SAMPLES FOR 
MARKET RESEARCH? 
RIWI specializes in providing programmatic respondents. Our proprietary technology manages 
recruiting and profiling 100% autonomously. Since 2018, our exclusive matchmaking algorithm has 
optimized respondent and survey fit using fresh/river sampling. Our clients include some of the 
industry’s largest market research firms, namely in the exchange platform category. 
 
2. PLEASE DESCRIBE AND EXPLAIN THE TYPE(S) OF ONLINE SAMPLE SOURCES FROM WHICH 
YOU GET RESPONDENTS. ARE THESE DATABASES? ACTIVELY MANAGED RESEARCH PANELS? 
DIRECT MARKETING LISTS? SOCIAL NETWORKS? WEB INTERCEPT (ALSO KNOWN AS RIVER) 
SAMPLES?  
Our respondents come from the ever-increasing base of mobile application users. We recruit these 
users via applications or websites with ads. Those that choose to participate in surveys can receive 
in-app currencies or real world incentives (e.g., coupons, gift cards, etc.).  
 
3. IF YOU PROVIDE SAMPLES FROM MORE THAN ONE SOURCE: HOW ARE THE DIFFERENT 
SAMPLE SOURCES BLENDED TO ENSURE VALIDITY? HOW CAN THIS BE REPLICATED OVER TIME 
TO PROVIDE RELIABILITY? HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF DUPLICATION OF 
RESPONDENTS ACROSS SOURCES? 
We have complete visibility into the source of each respondent through data collected both directly 
and indirectly from each user. Demographic data is also cross-checked with dummy attributes to 
improve data validity and reliability. We also maintain an as-large-as-possible portfolio to ensure 
diversity and representativeness. In addition, our multi-layer and multi-dimensional deduplication 
algorithm is able to identify repeat respondents before offering a survey to them to prevent duplicate 
responses. 
4. ARE YOUR SAMPLE SOURCE(S) USED SOLELY FOR MARKET RESEARCH? IF NOT, WHAT 
OTHER PURPOSES ARE THEY USED FOR? 
Our sample is mainly comprised of various mobile applications that leverage our survey offerings for 
in-app incentives rather than in-app offers. Users have the option to participate in any activity that 
suits them such as app installation. When sources come to us, we only use them for market 
research. 
5. HOW DO YOU SOURCE GROUPS THAT MAY BE HARD TO REACH ON THE INTERNET?  
We have established partnerships with local sample sources and local web applications in order to 
reach difficult regions. To date, we have worked in 229 countries. 
6. IF, ON A PARTICULAR PROJECT, YOU NEED TO SUPPLEMENT YOUR SAMPLE(S) WITH 
SAMPLE(S) FROM OTHER PROVIDERS, HOW DO YOU SELECT THOSE PARTNERS? IS IT YOUR 
POLICY TO NOTIFY A CLIENT IN ADVANCE WHEN USING A THIRD-PARTY PROVIDER? 
Our model has been built to maximize the reach and aggregation of numerus sources at any given 
time. Our system is optimized to provide maximum diversification and a maximum sample.

7. WHAT STEPS DO YOU TAKE TO ACHIEVE A REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE OF THE TARGET 
POPULATION? 
With user demographics available to us, our system is able to provide each survey with sample 
reflective of national statistic demographics. For more targeted sampling, greater population 
representation can be achieved through quota sampling. We are also able to increase the 
representativeness of our samples by leveraging varied mobile applications. 
 
8. DO YOU EMPLOY A SURVEY ROUTER? 
Yes, we have a survey router that has been built in-house.  
 
9. IF YOU USE A ROUTER: PLEASE DESCRIBE THE ALLOCATION PROCESS WITHIN YOUR 
ROUTER. HOW DO YOU DECIDE WHICH SURVEYS MIGHT BE CONSIDERED FOR A RESPONDENT? 
ON WHAT PRIORITY BASIS ARE RESPONDENTS ALLOCATED TO SURVEYS? 
We have developed a sophisticated algorithm designed to act as a matchmaker. This ‘matchmaker 
formula’ considers over 100 attributes at any given time to efficiently distribute users based on their 
demographic information, passive data such as user device and connection, and survey attributes. 
 
10. IF YOU USE A ROUTER: WHAT MEASURES DO YOU TAKE TO GUARD AGAINST, OR MITIGATE, 
ANY BIAS ARISING FROM EMPLOYING A ROUTER? HOW DO YOU MEASURE AND REPORT ANY 
BIAS? 
Our router contributes to a larger system where our proprietary algorithm considers all variables 
including routing, thus minimizing bias that would typically arise from router usage. 
 
11. IF YOU USE A ROUTER: WHO IN YOUR COMPANY SETS THE PARAMETERS OF THE ROUTER? 
IS IT A DEDICATED TEAM OR INDIVIDUAL PROJECT MANAGERS? 
As a tech-driven company, we have a dedicated data team responsible for monitoring and 
optimizing factors relating to the performance and quality of the overall system, including router 
optimization. 
 
12. WHAT PROFILING DATA IS HELD ON RESPONDENTS? HOW IS IT DONE? HOW DOES THIS 
DIFFER ACROSS SAMPLE SOURCES? HOW IS IT KEPT UP TO DATE? IF NO RELEVANT PROFILING 
DATA GET HELD, HOW ARE LOW-INCIDENCE PROJECTS HANDLED? 
As a result of our fresh sampling methodology, everything including the profiling process happens 
on the fly. These attributes expire within a month of their collection. 
13. PLEASE DESCRIBE YOUR SURVEY INVITATION PROCESS. WHAT IS THE PROPOSITION THAT 
PEOPLE ARE OFFERED TO TAKE PART IN INDIVIDUAL SURVEYS? WHAT INFORMATION ABOUT 
THE PROJECT ITSELF IS GIVEN IN THE PROCESS? APART FROM DIRECT INVITATIONS TO 
SPECIFIC SURVEYS (OR TO A ROUTER), WHAT OTHER MEANS OF INVITATION TO SURVEYS ARE 

 
 
 4 
RESPONDENTS EXPOSED TO? YOU SHOULD NOTE THAT NOT ALL INVITATIONS TO PARTICIPATE 
TAKE THE FORM OF EMAILS. 
Our survey invitation process is multi-step. Varying styles of offers including banner ads are 
presented in-app to mobile users with incentives based on the app they are using. Once a user 
enters the RIWI system, we capture additional demographic information and invite them to 
participate in a survey with defined attributes and rewards. Should an app-user consent, they will 
then proceed to enter the survey. 
 
14. PLEASE DESCRIBE THE INCENTIVES OFFERED TO RESPONDENTS FOR TAKING PART IN 
YOUR SURVEYS. FOR EXAMPLE, HOW DOES THIS DIFFER BY SAMPLE SOURCE, BY INTERVIEW 
LENGTH, BY RESPONDENT CHARACTERISTICS? 
Incentives provided are user-specific and generally based on the application they were using upon 
opt-in. Different offers and their associated values are automatically determined by our matchmaking 
algorithm. If a user is recruited through a mobile application, this incentive will come in the form of 
in-app currencies. Alongside real-world compensation such as coupons, this is the most common 
form of incentivization. 
 
15. WHAT INFORMATION ABOUT A PROJECT DO YOU NEED TO GIVE AN ACCURATE ESTIMATE 
OF FEASIBILITY USING YOUR OWN RESOURCES? 
In order to provide feasibility estimates, we require minimum qualifications to be defined (e.g. 
screenings and payouts per complete). However, any additional attributes will assist us in facilitating 
a smoother and faster fielding process. Examples of additional attributes include the length of 
surveys, incident rates, etc.  
 
16. DO YOU MEASURE RESPONDENT SATISFACTION? IS THIS INFORMATION MADE AVAILABLE 
TO CLIENTS? 
We periodically run internal assessments to measure respondent satisfaction and experience and 
are actively working toward expanding these initiatives. 
 
17. WHAT INFORMATION DO YOU PROVIDE TO DEBRIEF YOUR CLIENT AFTER THE PROJECT HAS 
FINISHED? 
No client debrief is required for our sample-only projects as these interactions happen automatically 
throughout the project process. Full-service projects, however, include project debriefs as part of 
the services provided by assigned project managers.  
18. WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DATA QUALITY CHECKS? IF IT IS YOU, DO YOU HAVE IN PLACE 
PROCEDURES TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE THAT WHICH IS UNDESIRED WITHIN SURVEY 
BEHAVIORS, SUCH AS (A) RANDOM RESPONDING, (B) ILLOGICAL OR INCONSISTENT 
RESPONDING, (C) OVERUSE OF ITEM NON-RESPONSE (SUCH AS "DON'T KNOW") OR (D) 
SPEEDING (TOO QUICK SURVEY COMPLETION)? PLEASE DESCRIBE THESE PROCEDURES. 

 
 
 5 
We use human and algorithmic tools to monitor data quality. Our system includes automated 
monitors while our internal data team also continually reviews daily activity to identify and mitigate 
the risk of undesirable survey-taker behaviour.   
 
19. HOW OFTEN CAN THE SAME INDIVIDUAL BE CONTACTED TO TAKE PART IN A SURVEY 
WITHIN A SPECIFIED PERIOD WHETHER THEY RESPOND TO THE CONTACT OR NOT? HOW DOES 
THIS VARY ACROSS YOUR SAMPLE SOURCES? 
Our system leverages the traffic of users entering in from various offers and as a result, we are not 
targeting panelists in the traditional sense. Our system also tracks users for a period of time to 
ensure they cannot return to the same survey or multiple different surveys in the same period. 
20. HOW OFTEN CAN THE SAME INDIVIDUAL TAKE PART IN A SURVEY WITHIN A SPECIFIED 
PERIOD? HOW DOES THIS VARY ACROSS YOUR SAMPLE SOURCES? HOW DO YOU MANAGE 
THIS WITHIN CATEGORIES AND/OR TIME PERIODS? 
Repeat participation is adjustable per project. In general, we limit users to monthly participation in 
surveys of similar categories. 
 
21. DO YOU MAINTAIN INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL DATA SUCH AS RECENT PARTICIPATION HISTORY, 
DATE OF ENTRY, SOURCE, ETC., ON YOUR SURVEY RESPONDENTS? ARE YOU ABLE TO SUPPLY 
YOUR CLIENT WITH A PROJECT ANALYSIS OF SUCH INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL DATA? 
Yes, we have a specific internal component for that purpose which logs all user interactions with the 
platforms including attempts, completes, screen outs, etc. We also offer analysis of this data as an 
additional service.  
 
22. DO YOU HAVE A CONFIRMATION OF THE RESPONDENT IDENTITY PROCEDURE? DO YOU 
HAVE PROCEDURES TO DETECT FRAUDULENT RESPONDENTS? PLEASE DESCRIBE THESE 
PROCEDURES AS THEY ARE IMPLEMENTED AT SAMPLE SOURCE REGISTRATION AND/OR AT THE 
POINT OF ENTRY TO A SURVEY OR ROUTER. IF YOU OFFER B2B SAMPLES, WHAT ARE THE 
PROCEDURES THERE, IF ANY? 
We do not ask for or store any identity related information on our users. The legitimacy of potential 
users is verified prior to study participation through suspicious traffic filtration. Fraudulent 
participants are also blocked from entering or viewing the main survey through digital fingerprinting 
(e.g., IP address checks), behavior analysis, history checks, and deduplication. A third-party service 
for fraud detection is also used to ascertain a score of fraud chance. 
 
23. PLEASE DESCRIBE THE 'OPT-IN FOR MARKET RESEARCH' PROCESSES FOR ALL YOUR 
ONLINE SAMPLE SOURCES. 
All participants must explicitly consent to participating in the market research before their data is 
processed.

24. PLEASE PROVIDE A LINK TO YOUR PRIVACY POLICY. HOW IS YOUR PRIVACY POLICY 
PROVIDED TO YOUR RESPONDENTS? 
A hyperlink without Privacy Policy is available on the first landing page that users visit when viewing 
our platform. The link is available here: https://researchonmobile.com/privacy-policy. 
 
25. PLEASE DESCRIBE THE MEASURES YOU TAKE TO ENSURE DATA PROTECTION AND DATA 
SECURITY.  
To ensure data protection and security, we process all inquiries regarding data deletion based on 
the user’s region of residence in a timely manner. 
 
26. WHAT PRACTICES DO YOU FOLLOW TO DECIDE WHETHER ONLINE RESEARCH SHOULD BE 
USED TO PRESENT COMMERCIALLY SENSITIVE CLIENT DATA OR MATERIALS TO SURVEY 
RESPONDENTS? 
For sample only projects, the contents of our surveys are managed by our clients. We work with 
client in cases where confidentiality is important by providing the necessary agreements and/or 
messaging to our respondents. For full service projects, RIWI works with clients to implement 
specific solutions that meet the individual needs of a project. 
 
27. ARE YOU CERTIFIED IN ANY SPECIFIC QUALITY SYSTEM? IF SO, WHICH ONE(S)? 
No, we are not currently certified in any specific quality systems. 
 
28. DO YOU CONDUCT ONLINE SURVEYS WITH CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE? IF SO, DO YOU 
ADHERE TO THE STANDARDS THAT ESOMAR PROVIDES? WHAT OTHER RULES OR 
STANDARDS, FOR EXAMPLE, COPPA IN THE UNITED STATES, DO YOU COMPLY WITH? 
We work exclusively with adult respondents.
