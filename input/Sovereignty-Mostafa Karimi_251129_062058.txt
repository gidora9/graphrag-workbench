In the beginning, heavier rock rules 
The idea of how we interact with each other has been controversial since the emergence of Homo 
sapiens (us) and still is among discoveries. At first, small tribes appeared and each one fought for its 
survival and so-called well-being. They used to gather resources for their tribes and families 
inhabiting small areas such as caves or tropical rainforests. Some explored and discovered other 
tribes and immediately reached the conclusion that there were some resources out there, for free! 
So, conflicts began, and each tribe fought to gain more resources and thus, slowly they learned to 
defend their clans as well. The rule was simple: whoever could lift the heavier rock and smash the 
defender wins the prize, as known as resources. There was simply no ruler or contract to restrain 
their power and no justice system to distribute the resources to all equally. But things slowly 
changed. 
 
Glance of civilization  
After hundreds of years, tribes became more populated and thus, new villages appeared, usually 
near the water. Then, the problem was not about a family or a few men, but about people. Therefore, 
a title should be created to serve not only a family of four, but hundreds of people. The title slowly 
appeared, and people thought it would be a good idea to let a wise man (or woman) who has more 
experience guide them through survival. So, early chiefs emerged and dedicated themselves to 
managing the power of the village. It was smart at first glance, but there was still a problem: a 
person could ruin the whole village alone! Imagine village A that is in close proximity to village B. 
They are about the same size and population. A father from village A, who is starving, is looking for 
a solution to feed their children. He cannot simply raid another family from his own village, because 
the chief can order the clan to execute him. So, he comes up with the idea to raid a family of clan B. 
After that raid, the chief of clan B responds by attacking his family to retaliate. Now, a family is dead 
in the territory of clan A, and the chief must respond to demonstrate authority and the will to 
protect his clan. As you might guess, the chief of clan B would also respond and this story would go 
on until no men were left from each clan. So, our ancestors concluded that it is wise not to solve the 
problem by invading another clan for a man’s fault. It is cleverer for B’s chief to contact A’s chief and 
inform him about what happened to a member of his clan and let A do justice to the man who did. 
So, the first interactions between the clans’ chiefs began. 
 
Unfinished mission 
Tribes became larger and became vessels, counties, and countries. Kings and queens emerged, and 
the power of the royal house sparked. People were obligated not only to obey and pay taxes to the 
kings, but also to other royal or local actors, such as Dukes, Knights, Princes, Marquesses, Earls, 
Viscounts, and Barons. It is not hard to predict that each hierarchy had its own rules and tastes. 
Time passed and the Roman Empire established and created the very first empire. Unlike previous 
rulers, who ruled over a tribe or a segment of population, Roman Emperors began to define

something we know as “sovereignty over territories”. The idea was simple: the emperor defines 
borders over lands and all the people in the territory, including kings and peasants, should obey and 
fight for the land. Unlike centuries before the Romans, only one person ruled and a foreign invasion 
to a county of the empire was equal to invading the whole empire. We were so close to the evolution 
of modern governance, but unfortunately, the Roman Empire fell and buried the fresh concept of 
sovereignty. Its concept of centralized power was shattered and in the absence of it, a system arose 
known as Feudalism. The aftermath of the fall of the Roman Empire was catastrophic, and dukes, 
knights, and barons started to rule again with their personal ideas and armies over segments of the 
population. Locality was personal, not strictly territorial. Again, power was fragmented. 
 
Westphalia ended the Armageddon 
After the Protestant Reformation which began in 1517, Europe split into two separate groups of 
Protestants and Catholics. It was both religious and political disagreement that lasted for almost a 
century. There was literally chaos ruling over the region and people were stuck between the 
contradiction of the governance of the Pope in the Holy Roman Empire and local dukes and princes 
in the era. It was 1618 when Protestant nobles in Bohemia rebelled against their Catholic ruler, the 
Holy Roman Empire. It was a disastrous war that changed the face of Europe forever. It was a free-
for-all catastrophe and major powers and kings stepped inside to weaken their rivals, which is 
estimated that Germany lost over twenty percent of its population. The war took thirty years 
(ending in 1648), and the idea of local religious beliefs spread across Europe. After decades of pain 
and suffering, all concluded that the old system failed and there should be new laws and agreements 
to move on. The idea of one singular universal ruler (Pope) was dead and without a winner, 
everyone was exhausted. At that obscure moment, a bright idea emerged that changed everything: a 
compromise from all leaders applied and brought the idea that no rulers should interfere in other 
territories’ laws and religious regulations, which is known as the Westphalia Agreement. “There 
should not be one true faith”, they said, “and each ruler can decide for their own land and we all 
respect that”. In short, Westphalia invented the concept of “sovereign” and drew thick and clear 
lines on the map and introduced the idea of “independent state”. It is interesting to note that 
Westphalia was not a philosophical revolution, but just a simple rulebook to prevent further 
disasters. The impact of the agreement is still observable across the globe. 
 
Let us take the torch 
For a century after Westphalia, the common idea was that the king IS the state. They assume the 
monarchy as a divine entity and consider the king as the descendant ruler and his kingdom as his 
property. The idea was that the king is like a householder and his land is his house; therefore, he has 
the right to do anything with his house and since his power is divine, it cannot be challenged by 
anyone on earth. But in the 17th and 18th centuries, the thinkers began to ask a very important 
question: What if the power to rule actually comes from below, and not above? The first figure who 
delved deeper into this problem was English philosopher John Locke. Born in 1632, he claimed that

people are born with natural rights. They have the right to live, to own property, and to gain liberty. 
He stepped back into history and found out that the first bedrock of creating a government was a 
social contract to protect those rights. The significance of the idea was that sovereignty remains 
with the people, and the government is just a caretaker of those rights. Several years later, a French 
philosopher took the boundaries even further. Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who was born in 1712, 
introduced a concept known as “General Will”, arguing that the true ruler is not just a group of 
individuals, but is the rules and regulations that best suit the entire community as a whole. The idea 
was simple: Laws should be made by the people. This concept was the starting point of a new idea, 
which we know as democracy. The idea left a profound impact on the next generations, American 
and French revolutions to name a few, and still plays an undeniable role in the current system of 
sovereignty. And that is the reason why the era is called “The Enlightenment Era”. 
 
Here we are, and also new challenges 
Millions of bloodsheds, and thousands of immoral actions took place to lead us to the 21st century, 
to home. Currently, all nations have their own borders, and all states govern over their territory. In 
most countries, people are the main indicators of their homeland laws and observe the government 
as a manager whom they hired to serve them. With new solutions come new problems, and many of 
our biggest threats simply ignore the borders. Global issues are rising more than ever, and it is our 
responsibility to deal with them. Several so-called First World countries produce a vast number of 
detrimental gases from their factories every single year and put our survival into question. A virus 
outbreak in a nation can become a global crisis in a week and disrupt the whole ordinary system. 
Some groups of hackers can sabotage other countries’ power grids, banks, and election systems and 
no border can stop them. The question is: how can we deal with the borderless problems? Several 
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and global institutions emerged to counter those threats. 
The United Nations Security Council can authorize action against countries that threaten world 
peace. The European Union can protect certain nations if they give up their sovereignty to the 
community. And there are more Global Institutions that ignore the borders just to keep us all alive. 
Another dilemma that we are facing is “the protection of the rights of domestic civilians”. Imagine a 
government brutally murdering its own people. Should other nations respect the “no-interfere” idea 
of Westphalia, or should they protect the other nation’s civilians? This brings us to the principle of 
“Responsibility to Protect (R2P)”, which is mentioned in the UN. According to this idea, governments 
are responsible for protecting their people, and if they fail or refuse to do so, the responsibility falls 
on the international community. So, to sum it up, sovereignty in the modern age is not just to protect 
the land and not interfere with others, but the new concept is to negotiate with neighboring 
countries to solve a bigger problem; a problem that does not stand behind the borders.
