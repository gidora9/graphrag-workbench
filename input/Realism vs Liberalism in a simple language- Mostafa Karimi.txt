    In the modern world, it is quite important to know the behavior of and attitudes of a state or a player. In 
the discipline of International Relations, there are two main ideologies that significantly impact the 
actions of a nation. This essay will explain both and highlight their main differences. 
    The first approach is known as Realism and has been around since ancient times and first expressed 
clearly by the Italian philosopher Niccolo Machiavelli in late 15
th
 century. Realism assumes that we live in 
a chaotic world in which each state puts its interests first. 
 To put it simply, realists do not trust anyone in the globe and work hard to defend themselves from all 
external threats. They believe that humankind acts only to gain advantage from others and one should 
always put themselves over others for they also think that their advantage is to gain self-centered 
concessions. It is believed by realists that international politics has no higher authority to enforce laws, 
and morality usually takes second place for survival and power and there is no governor on a global scale, 
and one should be fully prepared to defend itself against other players at all costs. 
Imagine several tribes in an unknown desert who want to survive. Each tribe should always be alerted to 
defend its tribe against other tribes. No one is really looking to help other tribes because if they gain 
advantage, they will definitely attack other tribes and steal their resources to survive better and longer. 
There are no police or governors to make tribes feel safe around other tribes and one should always be 
alerted to protect one’s tribe from the other. As it is defined in the zero-sum game, gain of tribe A is equal 
to lose for tribe B and vice versa. 
 Another assumption of realism is that it treats the state as a single actor that speaks with one voice, 
especially in matters of war and security. According to this assumption, no matter how many self-interest 
or governmental organizations are included in the body of a state or how many powerful individuals rule 
over a country with their varying interests; at the end of the day, they should act as one according to 
benefit of the whole state, and that is why their power is limited. All in all, realism is often criticized as 
excessively pessimistic, since it sees the confrontational nature of the international system as inevitable. 
   Another school of thought, which is quite different from realism, is known as Liberalism. It is first 
officially introduced by the German philosopher Immanuel Kant in 18
th
 century and developed by several 
critical thinkers over time. 
Compared to realism, liberalism argues that humankind can cooperate with each other for the sake of 
humanity and benefits. The ideology believes that states are stronger and happier when they share their 
benefits.  
A good analogy states that there are two hunters who want to catch prey. If they hunt on their own, they 
will catch a bunny each, but if they coordinate, they can put a massive bait for a bigger animal, and both 
can gain much more food. Different from realism, liberalism argues that gain for A does not necessarily 
mean lose for B if they share the same interests. The ideology argues that conflict between states can be 
mitigated with connection and trade. 
Another key factor in this idea is that it states that governments tend to prioritize individuals’ wellbeing. 
Thus, the human right, election, and free speech are often more visible in liberalist countries. It is worth 
mentioning that liberalism emphasizes the importance of creation and working with international 
institutions and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to build trust and benefits for all players to 
counter the danger of isolated countries’ behavior. In this school of thought, multiple organizations 
should establish control and limit the power of singular players and endorse the freedom and serenity of 
all mankind. Comparing to realism, liberalism is considered to be the “optimistic” view because it argues 
that cooperation, institutions, trade, and democracy make peace more likely and create shared gains and 
the mankind should benefit from wellbeing and right to live.

  It is worth comparing both ideologies in a relative example: 
Imagine the Russia-Ukraine war. In realism point of view, Russia invaded Ukraine to prevent NATO from 
getting too close and to create a buffer zone. But a liberalist points that if Russia was more open and 
traded with the West, this war would not happen for the Russia and the West had singular benefit and 
losing one would mean losing for the other too. 
This essay has recapped the most important and bold key definitions of these two mindsets. It is clear that 
both ideologies have more profound definitions, and one should delve deeper into these beliefs if 
interested.
