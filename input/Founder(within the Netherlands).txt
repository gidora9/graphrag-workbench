2 Tuberculosis 
 
You want to apply for a residence permit in the Netherlands. You may need to undergo an examination and 
treatment for tuberculosis (TB). This depends on the situation. 
 
>  Please tick the applicable situation 
 
 You do not need to undergo a TB test because you have a valid residence permit in the Netherlands.  
 You do not need to undergo a TB test because you are a national of one of the countries listed in the appendix 
‘Exemption from the obligation to undergo a tuberculosis (TB) test’. 
 You do not need to undergo a TB test because you were born in the Netherlands and you have not changed 
the location of your principal place of residence to outside the Netherlands since your birth. 
You have a different nationality and: 
 have already undergone a TB test in the Netherlands. Enclose an original and recent ‘TB test referral form’ 
with the application. This form is the proof that you have undergone a TB test in the Netherlands. The form 
may not be more than 6 months old. 
 have not yet undergone a TB test in the Netherlands. Then you should complete the Appendix Declaration of 
intent to undergo a TB test’ and send this together with the application. You must sign this appendix yourself. 
 
If you are in the Netherlands, then you should make an appointment for the test with the Municipal Health Service 
(GGD) in the region where you live or where you will be living (for further information, visit the website 
www.ggd.nl). Take the appendix ‘TB test referral form’ with you to the Municipal Health Service (GGD).

3 Means of evidence 
 
Requirements of foreign means of evidence 
You must gather together the means of evidence before submitting your application. You may be required to 
submit foreign means of evidence together with this application, for example a foreign marriage certificate. Your 
personal situation and the purpose of residence determine which foreign proof of income you will need to include. 
 
Language 
All foreign means of evidence must be compiled in Dutch, English, French or German. Is this not the case? Then 
you must have the means of evidence translated by a translator who has been sworn in by a District Court. 
Submit (a copy of) the translation and (a copy of) the means of evidence together with the application form. If 
you have the means of evidence translated in a foreign country and therefore not by a translator who has been 
sworn in by a District Court, then you are required to have the translation legalised or to have an apostille 
stamp/authentication stamp provided by the competent authorities in the country of issue. 
 
  

 
  
 
3 
7558-2025/3 
Official means of evidence 
Official foreign means of evidence must be issued and legalised by the competent authorities of the country that 
issued the means of evidence. In some countries the document must then also be legalized by the Dutch embassy 
or the Dutch consulate in the country in question. In ‘apostille countries’ an apostille, issued by the competent 
local authorities, is sufficient. If no Dutch embassy or consulate is available in that country, the document must be 
legalised by the Dutch embassy or consulate responsible for that country. Official foreign means of evidence 
include, for example, birth certificates and marriage certificates. Having these means of evidence legalised or 
provided with an apostille stamp can take a long time. You should start several months in advance of submitting 
your application with having documents legalised or provided with an apostille stamp in the country of origin. For 
more information about legalisation or apostille requirements for documents per country and any exceptions to 
these requirements, you can telephone the ‘Public Information Service’, telephone number 1400. 
You can also visit 
the website www.rijksoverheid.nl. 
 
Special facts and circumstances 
If you think special facts and circumstances may apply, that have to be considered when assessing your 
application, you have to provide a written declaration. You have to substantiate this declaration with as many 
(official) means of evidence as possible. 
 
If you submit special circumstances in the context of Article 3.6ba, first paragraph, of the Aliens Decree, you must 
only submit these circumstances if this concerns your first application submitted in the Netherlands.

Please enclose the following means of evidence with your application: 
• A step-by-step plan that contains information on: 
 your role and tasks in the start-up company (the organisation); You must have an active role. This means

3.2 Facilitator 
With your application you have to enclose evidence on the reliability and expertise of the facilitator. 
 
Please note! If, in the year before you submit your application, the RVO gave a positive recommendation with 
respect to the facilitator, you need not produce any evidence on the reliability and expertise of the facilitator. In 
that case, the RVO will assume that the facilitator is reliable and an expert. 
 
If the RVO has not given a positive recommendation before or gave a positive recommendation more than one 
year ago, enclose with your application: 
• As many means of evidence as possible showing the expertise of the facilitator: 
 The facilitator offers you a ‘tailor-made’ package of    facilities. A ‘tailor-made’ package means that the 
facilitator is able to facilitate the start-up entrepreneur in developing the idea into a business. This 
depends on the facilitation required by the start-up entrepreneur. The facilitator may, for example, assist 
in the business operations, marketing, conducting of research and search for investors in order to set up 
the innovative company. The agreement between you and your facilitator must include arrangements in 
this respect. 
 The facilitator is experienced. Experience means at least 2 years’ experience with facilitating innovative 
start-up entrepreneurs. At least 2 persons should be able to facilitate you. They can do this either jointly 
or alone with an equivalent substitute. You can demonstrate this by means of, for example, a business 
plan, examples of previously facilitated start-up entrepreneurs, references and CVs. If several persons act 
as facilitator, information about all facilitators will be required. 
• As many means of evidence as possible showing that the facilitator is reliable. The facilitator must be 
financially sound. In any case, the facilitator has not been granted a moratorium, has not been declared 
insolvent. He has a healthy solvency and liquidity ratio (no negative shareholders’ equity). For the facilitator 
must support you for at least 1 year. You can demonstrate this by means of, for example, recent financial 
statements (the RVO can inspect the financial statements of organisations that have a filing obligation with 
the Chamber of Commerce), agreements with or guarantees by financiers, audit opinions, bank statements 
and/or substantiated financial prognoses. 
 
4 Biometric information, signature and Antecedents certificate

Appendix Statement due to European sanctions against Russia

The European Union has introduced various sanctions against Russia and Belarus as a result of Russia's invasion of 
Ukraine. More information about the sanctions and which people, companies and organisations in Russia and Belarus 
are on a sanctions list can be found on: www.sanctionsmap.eu. These sanctions may have consequences for the

persons included on a sanctions list. Under the Sanctions Act, it is in fact prohibited to make funds and/or economic 
resources available to listed companies or persons. The effect of the prohibition also extends to companies that are not 
on a sanctions list themselves, but are indeed owned by or under the control of a listed company or person. By making

the sanctions list.
