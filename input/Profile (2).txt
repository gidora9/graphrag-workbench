Ebrahim Eskandari
Product Executive | Scaled Marketplace to $2M ARR | SaaS & Data
Platforms | GM & P&L Owner
Istanbul, Istanbul, Türkiye
Summary
I am a product executive with a proven record of scaling complex
platforms into measurable revenue growth.
Most recently at RIWI Corp, I built and scaled a new respondent
marketplace from zero to **$2M ARR in 12 months**, owning the full
P&L, product strategy, and go-to-market execution. I transformed
fragmented manual processes into scalable products, optimized
supply and demand operations, and led a cross-functional team
across product, engineering, and growth to create a repeatable
growth engine.
Before that, as Co-Founder and COO of Research on Mobile, I
helped grow the company to **over $2.5M in revenue** and played
a central role in its successful acquisition by RIWI. Across both
ventures, I consistently bridged business strategy, technology, and
data to deliver real commercial impact.
Today, I am building **Game Scrobbler**, a unified gaming analytics
platform designed to help developers turn raw player data into
actionable insights. I treat it as a strategic side venture while actively
pursuing my next full-time leadership role.
Core strengths:
• Building and scaling SaaS and marketplace platforms from zero to
growth stage  
• Owning P&L and aligning product strategy directly with revenue
outcomes  
• Leading distributed, cross-functional teams across product,
engineering, and operations  
• Turning complex data systems into simple, high-value customer
experiences

• Driving disciplined go-to-market execution and operational
efficiency  
I am currently **open to senior product leadership roles**—including
Product Lead, Head of Product, Director of Product Management, or
General Manager positions—where I can help organizations scale
products, teams, and revenue.
I bring an entrepreneurial mindset, structured execution, and a bias
toward measurable results—and I am ready for the next challenge.
