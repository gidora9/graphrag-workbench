GamerSeal
The Unified Trust Layer for Competitive Gaming

We Provide Proof,
Not Policing.
GamerSeal is not another anti-cheat, KYC vendor, or results tool. It is a trust
and identity integrity layer that sits before the game and outside anti-cheat.
Core Function: We prove a player is who they claim to be and plays where they claim to
play.

"The missing piece of the competitive ecosystem."

Competitive Gaming is Exploding,
But Trust is Collapsing.

100M+
Competitive Players

80%
of amateur tournaments run on
free platforms with minimal
verification.

estimated annual losses from
tournament fraud.

Organizers and Platforms Face an
Impossible Choice.
Neither path allows for scalable, trusted competition.

The "Frictionless" Path
Allow anyone to sign up easily.
RESULT
High Fraud, Low Trust, Constant
Disputes.


The "Secure" Path
Implement manual verification and
screenshot checks.
RESULT
High Friction, Low Scale, Frustrated
Players.


GamerSeal Introduces the Third Path:
Frictionless but Verified.
We provide low-friction, high-confidence, optionally invisible trust
infrastructure. This is the missing piece no platform has successfully built.

The Four Critical Gaps in the Competitive
Ecosystem

The Identity Integrity Gap
Social logins don't verify account ownership, history, or
prevent smurfing.
GSEAL FILLS IT
Device consistency, cross-platform clustering, behavior
timelines.

The Tournament Trust Gap
No shared banlists or identity graphs exist between
platforms. Fraud is isolated and repeated.
GSEAL FILLS IT
A shared Trust Graph across all participating platforms.

The Scalable Verification Gap
Manual checks are slow and unreliable. KYC is too
expensive and heavy for 99% of tournaments.
GSEAL FILLS IT
A lightweight, automated, opt-in verification layer.
⭐
The Player Reputation Gap
Players have no portable, persistent trust identity or
incentive to build "fair-play capital."
GSEAL FILLS IT
A player-owned trust passport.

Our Engine is Powered by
Three Distinct Proof Paths.

Creating a Universal and Instantly
Recognizable Trust Signal
The three proof paths combine to generate a compound trust score and a simple,
visual badge that travels with the player across the ecosystem.

Our Strategic Window: Tournament Platforms
Do Not Want to Build Identity
They would rather outsource this function to a trusted, frictionless partner.
Building it themselves is a strategic liability.
