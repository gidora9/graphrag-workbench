Executive Summary
Born in Brazil is a milestone-based feasibility initiative designed to validate a premium immi-

Costs are milestone-triggered and project-specific (not compensation).
• Legal & Immigration (Brazil): 5k – 12k
• Medical (Delivery & Care): 4k – 8k
• Certified Docs, Relocation, Advisory: 5k – 14k
•Total Indicative Range: 14k – 34k
B. Breakeven Logic (Conservative)
Breakeven is defined as the recovery of feasibility costs.
•Year-1 Exposure (Sponsored):36k (Stipend) + 24k (Costs) =60k Total.
•Recovery:With client fees at 30k–50k, breakeven occurs within1–2 cases.
C. Market Demand Drivers

• Brazil chosen forjus soli(unconditional birthright citizenship) and democratic passport strength.
• Absence of quota-based or investment-heavy constraints common in EU paths.
D. Supporting Documentation Generated
Internal playbooks, case files, private hospital pricing data, and legal compliance checklists.
E. Market Landscape & Trends
•Global Growth:Market valued at $299.9M (2024), projected to reach $449.5M by 2030.
•Shift to LATAM:Restrictive North American policies are driving demand to Brazil.

CompetitorEst. Pricing  Positioning
BirthAway$2k – $3.5k   Budget aggregator; transactional; focus on documents.
BabyInBrazil∼$8kMid-tier; regional focus (Florianópolis); basics included.
Hale HealthCustomLuxury/Medical focus; armored transport; high-net-worth.
Shadow Market  $5k – $35k   Unregulated facilitators; high risk; predatory pricing.
G. Strategic Gaps & Opportunities
1.Legitimacy Deficit:High-value clients fear the "shadow market." BiB offers corporate trans-
parency.
2.Standardization:Absence of a scalable, defensible playbook across medical/legal verti-
cals.
3.The Venture Void:Current competitors are lifestyle businesses. BiB aims to build a trans-
ferable asset class.
