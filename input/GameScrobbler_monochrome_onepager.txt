Digital Sovereignty for the Gaming Generation
1. THE CORE PROBLEM
Gaming is the primary digital habitat for youth, yet it operates on a feudal model: platforms own identity, achievements, reputation,
and behavioral data. Players build value they cannot own or move — contradicting Europe’s vision for data portability, rights, and
Digital Sovereignty.
2. WHO’S HURT
• Invisible Talent: Youth in emerging markets and diaspora communities develop teamwork, strategy, and cognitive skills that
remain unseen by education and labor systems.
• Disenfranchised Creatives: Indie EU developers face locked APIs and platform monopolies.
• The Player: Fragmented identity, no control over data, and exposure to toxicity without tools for digital wellnbeing.
3. OUR INTERVENTION: PLAYGRAPH
PlayGraph is a usernowned, interoperable data layer: a protocol for data portability, transparency, and control. A ‘digital health
record’ for gameplay — turning skill, behavior, and reputation into portable, verifiable identity signals.
• Aligned with GDPR, DMA, DSA, and the EU AI Act.
• Progress becomes portable, skills become verifiable, and data usage becomes transparent.
4. SOCIAL IMPACT
• Economic Mobility: Gameplay → softnskill indicators → career and education pathways for underrepresented youth.
• Digital Dignity: Users gain meaningful control over how AI systems train on their behavior.
• Open Innovation: Ethical, standardized data access enables EU studios to compete globally.
5. WHY NOW & WHY WAC
Regulatory momentum (Data Act, DMA, DSA, AI Act) is forcing the shift toward interoperability, transparency, and userncontrolled
identity. Gaming has surpassed social networks as the largest identity space for youth. WAC’s mission — digital rights, inclusion,
empowerment — aligns directly with PlayGraph as the infrastructure enabling those values.
Together, we can make gaming the first global ecosystem where users truly own who they are.
